42,0,Profit is meaningful
43,0,"profit attracts talent so that the technology will surely survive. Like tech bubble, did burst but what left turely changed the course of mankind"
44,0,"I'm very happy that there are still people around like mr. Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own."

This is caused by large numbers of uninformed people investing just to ""hop on the ride"" to make profits, very similar to what happened in crypto last months."
58,,
59,,
60,0,Why can't it be both?
61,0,Vitalik knows whats up. Respect to the guy.
62,0,I would think one of the first steps to cryptos achieving something meaningful is widespread adoption and public awareness. Price surges are a result of those two things.
63,0,For example Sia👌
64,1,This is why Ethereum is great. The fact that it's a computing platform and not just a currency will only make it valuable as time goes on unlike something like Bitcoin.
65,0,The success of Ethereum has increased the number of douche bags in this forum.  That will happen with anything that gets popular though.  I know he will see through all the BS and keep working hard on Ethereum.
66,0,I still think he was sent here from another galaxy to help humanity :). he is also correct in his statement.
67,0,"He's clearly thinking on another level from a seeming majority of people on crypto-related subs, and that saddens me, though I can't say I'm surprised."

75,,
76,,
77,0,"I don't think this is a bad thing. Prices right now are almost all driven by speculation. If the technology behind it proves, with time, to be a valuable real asset it will be good because then prices will be backed up by something more.than speculation."
78,0,headline: Young impressionable genius finds out the truth about business
79,0,The important thing being done is proving that crypto is useful and has a purpose. I'm not convinced any of these first round technologies will last but the are paving the way for sure.
80,0,"I mean, he's not wrong..."
81,0,"The big focus these days for many people is simply profit.  Society appears so dark to me, and in many ways increasingly going in a direction I feel is wrong.  I believe the crypto world is achieving something meaningful simply for it's disruptive technological factor.  All of it is giving the younger generations a greater chance to understand the underlying mechanisms at play in this world through a greater transparency of systems of scalability.  This whole universe is energy and there's many different forms of 'coin' that energy comes in.  Learning these dynamics are spiritually enlightening to me.  It's kind of nice to be able to profit while learning and so it's meaningful to me.  If others miss this message for the sake of profit, well that's their loss.  Some carve meaning out of their existence here on Earth, some show others how not to."
82,0,When you completely agree but you also want to be rich
83,0,That is why there shouldn't be support for centralized cryptos.
84,,
85,,
86,,
87,,
88,0,Like fast and reliable wallet. I still can't use Mist or Parity on my PC because it won't sync.
89,0,Most alt coins just talk about something meaningful
90,0,"Yeah, well for most of us that's exactly what crypto profits are : meaningful to us."
91,0,"just remember he didn't do it to get rich he liked the idea behind blockchain and the future it could provide, when you see him in public does he look like he has millions? you don't get much more down to earth than him really"

101,0,Pretty sure he wants more lambo memes and sharding jokes.  /s
102,0,"There are so many investors on Reddit claiming they put their money into crypto because they ""believe"" in what is still an early, basically beta stage technology and who knows where it will be and which coins survive in 2-5 years."

137,0,You mean like when /u/coblee sold his stack for fear of conflicting interests?
138,0,Why not both?
139,1,Alot of people making sick gains right now. When the bubble ultimately does come the bull shit will fall to the wayside.
140,0,"Vitalik, the philosipher and do-gooder, is using cryptocurrency to make the world good again."
141,,
142,0,Vitalik should really point the finger at all those b.s. ERC20 token ICO's on the Ethereum block chain...majority of them are scam tokens.
143,0,Says the guy with the biggest lambo collection on earth
144,0,Let’s focus on that after I buy a lambo
145,0,Say it with me now
146,,
147,,
148,,
149,0,He says that afterrrr hes rich
150,0,"I thought making money for wealthy/early investors was the only upside to crypto?  Want to do something meaningful, maybe do something other than work on what's only used as a toy for the rich."
151,0,Totally agree. The improvment upon daily life that can be made thru this tech should be the main focus.
152,0,"He has a great point, for himself. But most people only want to provide for their family and live a comfortable life."
153,-1,"Why do people believe cryptocommodities will replace reserve currencies when other, more liquid and secure commodities have not?"
154,0,"This exact reason is why I refused to invest into XRP. Profit would be nice, but I don't like a few things the company was doing in hopes of profiting from."
155,0,Should I report this for price discussion ;-)
156,1,Why not both? I mean for me that is the biggest promise of smart contracts - that we can take that enormous power of human greed and somehow direct it so people will automatically help each other. It could work with something like Steemit (not actually Steemit ofcourse because unfortunatelly it's not decentralized but controled by oligarchy).
157,0,"Do your research; they have already - it is called BOINC and GridCoin, and Folding@home and CureCoin.."

160,0,I want to contribute to achieving something meaningful but simply don't know how.
161,,

164,0,He want achieving something meaningful? Well how about  if he gives all hes erh to a man in a third world country? For me a third world man that  wil be meaningful
165,-1,"One word, bubble. Be safe all."
166,-1,"Cryptocurrency is a failure. If you can't buy bread with it, it's not a currency."
167,0,"Translated: ""fucking ripple... Really?"""
168,-1,I don't see how more money into the crypto space is a problem. Frankly it seems like the development side is not meeting the needs of the people. Ethereum network slumped when crypto kitties launched. Really? A fucking game crashed your precious ether. I remember ether transactions being delayed 24hrs because of it. It sounds like Vitalek needs to stop talking about the price and focus on developing ether. Or we could just use a better coin. Like ubiq. Probably just solidifies an incoming bear market for crypto in general. The hype has been there for a year. Now it's time for devs and teams to take profits and start developing for the next couple years until the next wave of mainstream adoption.
169,0,"What? Meaning? Ideals? I guess I'm out of here; I'm too poor to have the luxury of having those things. It doesn't matter how good my ideas and meaningful achievements are/can be if I'm starving on the street, or on the verge of being homeless. So many people went to college because they think they'll be achieving something meaningful end up being unhireable because they insist that they exist on the Earth not to be some drones on a corporate machine, but to ""Achieve Something Meaningful""- they may have dreams, but then they keep on dreaming, until they dream forever."

179,0,"If you build it they will come is what I got from that.   Do something revolutionary with the protocols he developed and the profits will stay forever.  If not, it'll burn out like a fad."
180,0,When the smoke clears the proper value creating teams and companies will remain.
181,0,That comes later
182,0,"I disagree, focusing on profit keeps the money coming in enabling those with the right skills the ability through funding to further the technology"
183,0,It's like he predicted today's Ripple rush.

187,-1,"Go to https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf and search for words like ""money"", ""profit"", ""value"", and ""dollar"" and see if any of them suggest economic prosperity outside of the network. Ether guy is right, crypto isn't for profit."

204,0,It's really high time to do that.
205,0,"Lots of good quotes from Vitalik in http://strategiccoin.com/chronicles-1/. Tried to create a #VitalikSpeaks thread on Twitter, but haven't gotten any takers yet."

216,0,"Nobody wants to tell the world how much money they have, and it’s my understanding that that is what ethereum does."

220,,
221,,
222,0,"Translation: the revenge of centralized systems is upon us, all hail the new crypto overlord, Ripple."
223,0,Well he is quite right to say that but looking at him he is the most richest young guy out there so it is easy to say that as well.
224,0,"He should give away all his premined tokens if he believes this. Otherwise admit that personally enriching himself drove him to build Ethereum, and that's actually good."
225,0,Sorry but... profit is meaningful...

We need real world value not just speculation. I would welcome a strong correction to flush these lambo-douches out.
283,-1,"Except that every token being created faces the immediate label of being a pump and dump, get rich quick scheme. While I agree that most are, it’s becoming an increasing battle to make a case for making your own token as opposed to using the underlying blockchain coin. It’s even becoming to the point where you discuss ICO or crowdsale and you are immediate looked down upon. So unless, we expect projects with zero resources,  I’d be hard pressed to see any motivation for getting crypto other than to speculate. So what do we actually mean when we say purpose here?"

309,,
310,,
311,0,"This is basically why I made this [Truffle Box](https://github.com/adrianmcli/truffle-next/) for React devs looking to start making dapps. I even wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@adrianli/rapid-ethereum-dapp-development-with-next-js-f6354400e4d4) about it, but it didn't really catch on."
312,0,"Layman here. Why do you think it has the potential to change the world? If it replaces my means of payment for goods and services, I guess I don't see how that's going to change my life."
313,0,Press 'F' to pay respects in ETH.
314,0,He got that way by thinking the way he does. Actual value is a better long bet than perceived value.
315,,
316,,
317,0,"What's that got to with anything? He didn't say people shouldn't focus on profit, he said cryptocurrencies shouldn't. And he's absolutely right. There are thousands of shitcoins now and bitcoin hard forks coming by the day that provide nothing new. The only reason they exist is so their creators can offload them to traders to pump and dump."
318,0,So? Vitalik has always focused on the tech and has never been a pumper. He has every right to express this.

334,0,"On paper - yes, in reallity - no.If he decides to dump his ETH, Ethereum will die reeeeeally quickly and probably will drop its price."
335,-1,You guys are pretty stupid huh. He is talking about the necessary mindset to make crypto a lasting and widespread phenomena. Currently it doesn't work well enough for it to be reasonable for worldwide use. Therefore any value attributed to crypto is more of a bubble than actual value.
336,0,I don’t think he would care much if he loses it. He hasn’t changed a bit. In fact he is working more and more passionate about his project.

349,0,Or maybe he followed his own advice and knows what hes talking about.
350,0,The best way to ensure that it continues to be valuable is that there is some use of it outside of just hodling it.
351,,
352,,
353,0,He really doesn't give me the impression that it changed him. He's still working hard at his goal and not living the coke and hooked lifestyle.
354,0,That’s not at all what 40 under 40 is.
355,0,To be fair he sold off a large portion of his Ethereum holdings some time ago. His net worth is based on a bit more than how much crypto he owns.
356,0,"Lol what would you rather him say, that we should only be focusing on pumping more money into it..?"
357,0,"Vitalik is not $ oriented lol, he's the opposite of that. Didn't he donate most of his coins? Also he mentioned that he's only willing to advise projects in which he believes will have a meaningful and positive impact to society."

360,,
361,,

363,0,Right. Fuck this nerd
364,0,"Cute, but breathtakingly obtuse."

371,-1,Thanks to a massive pre-mine on ETH.

203        > now you have a lot of people wanting to make a quick buck fast and displaying no interest to educate themselves about what they buy, the worst part is that they are loud and pollute the discussions.

The worst part is that, at least for now and over the past few months, those people are also *right*... you could have put a chart of the top 100 cryptos by market cap circa Jan 2017 on a dart board, closed your eyes and thrown three darts, put a few thousand bucks into each of them, and be a millionaire today. I bet only about 1% of all crypto holders worldwide actually have a deep understanding of the tech behind the crypto they hold. The other 99% only understand two things: how/where to buy, and price trend. They don't know and frankly don't care how the tech works, because while the entire crypto market is still in its mania phase, there's almost no difference between the smart money and stupid money in the market.

The entire premise that wealth or income inequality matters is flawed for reasons you wouldn't accept if you already believe that it's expedient for society as a whole to extort funds from the most productive people to squander them on entitlements. If you really care to know, lmk.

Those are 1st grade thoughts."
