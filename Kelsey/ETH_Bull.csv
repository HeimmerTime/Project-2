"Frothy Squared: Crypto Firms Are Lining Up to Tap Market Mania
Vildana Hajric, Olga Kharif and Olivia Raimonde
,
Bloomberg News
An engineer runs diagnostics on rigs mining the Ethereum and Zilliqa cryptocurrencies at the Evobits crypto farm in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2021. The worlds second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, rallied 75% this year, outpacing its larger rival Bitcoin. Photographer: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg                         , Bloomberg
(Bloomberg) -- The IPO fever whipping up animal spirits in the stock market has spilled over into the crypto-sphere.
After watching investors pour millions into blank-check companies and seeing the likes of JFrog and Snowflake surge after market debuts, at least eight crypto firms are eyeing initial public offerings. Coinbase has filed. Other exchanges are laying out plans or looking to be acquired through special-acquisition vehicles. And two Bitcoin mining equipment firms in China are on IPO watch lists, according to Renaissance Capital.
While its somewhat surprising that an industry that prides itself on being an outsider to financial-market infrastructure has eyes for public listings, for some investors it is downright worrying. The IPO mania alone is enough to stoke bubble worries, but adding crypto to the mix after its record run is fueling concern that investors are setting themselves up for an especially painful comeuppance.
Crypto is chronically frothy. IPOs are chronically frothy. Were in the frothy phases for both right now, said Aaron Brown, a crypto investor and Bloomberg Opinion writer. So crypto IPOs this year? Frothy-squared.
The IPO market has been red-hot since last fall as companies rushed to take advantage of the 70% surge in stocks since the March lows. Public debuts and blank-check companies have grown so popular that record after record fell. And first-day pops in share prices, a barometer of investor appetite for newly public firms, are among the biggest in decades.
It has all become too much to ignore for the crypto industry.
Coinbase and eToro, as well as MicroBT, a mining company, have spurred chatter of public offerings slated for this year, according to Renaissance, which provides IPO ETFs and institutional pre-IPO research. A handful of others -- Gemini Trust Co., a crypto exchange, and Bitmain Technologies and Bitfury, two firms centered around mining -- may also join the wave of new entrants.
Its clear a gap has opened between private and public markets valuation for tech companies, inciting startups to fast track a potential IPO, said Emmanuel Goh, co-founder and chief executive officer of Skew, a data analytics and trade execution platform focused on cryptocurrency derivatives. Given current appetite for cryptocurrencies, I expect extremely strong demand for bellwether crypto companies that are already turning a profit.
Coinbase, which was valued at more than $8 billion in 2018, has ignited some of the biggest excitement. The company filed last month to go public in what many are arguing amounts to be a breakthrough moment for the industry. The exchange has about 35 million verified users and more than $25 billion in assets on its platform, Bloomberg reported. Coinbase declined to comment for this story.
Crypto enthusiasts have long sought a warmer embrace from Wall Street, wagering that greater mainstream acceptance could help usher in a period of growth. Its a prognostication that was borne out in part last year, when institutional entrants helped push Bitcoin to new highs.
Its a pure-play bet on the fastest growing industry in the world, crypto, and were in the loosest money regime in history, said Nic Carter, co-founder of researcher Coin Metrics. Carter added that he expects others to follow Coinbase.
To Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, its a good environment for crypto firms to consider public debuts. Institutional adoption means there are deep pockets that are willing to invest, especially while crypto prices are skyrocketing.
If youre going to raise capital, its good to do it while the wind is in your sails, he said. He doesnt think its a frothy indicator.
The latest coin price rally is also partly why crypto miners are seeing high demand, according to Christopher Bendiksen, head of research at asset manager CoinShares.
Theres a bottleneck in supply, he said, adding that most mining equipment makers have all their expected inventory prepaid for six months in advance. At this point I dont think they are even taking a call.
But many have questioned how much hotter crypto prices can get following a blockbuster 2020, when Bitcoin notched record after record. About 60% of returns since October can be explained by market exuberance and momentum trading, according to an analysis from Bloomberg Economics.
Bitcoin has come off its highs after it crossed $40,000 this month, but is still up about 16% this year. A survey of more than 620 market professionals by Deutsche Bank showed that 50% of respondents gave Bitcoin the maximum 10 out of 10 bubble rating. Whether it is will only be evident in hindsight. Investors with long memories, though, are taking note.
Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., says the wave of potential IPOs is something typically seen toward the end of a bullish run. While the trend might not be indicative of an imminent crash and hes bullish on crypto, its still reminiscent of the type of exuberance seen at the height of the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s.
When a bunch of companies in the same sector go public at the same time, it tells you that the people who run those companies realize that their valuations are very high, and might be looking to capitalize on it, he said. The smart guys are taking advantage of this parabolic move right now.

"Bitcoin bounces off support at $30,000 as a double-bottom pattern hints breakout back to $40,000.
Ethereum slumps to $1,045 just days after trading a new all-time high at $1,440.
Ripple is motionless above $0.26 after a minor recovery from price levels around $0.25.
It was bloodshed in the cryptocurrency market on Thursday and the Asian session on Friday. The majority of crypto assets plummeted from their weekly peaks, cutting short plans to rally to new record highs. Ethereum, for instance, plunged to $1,000, temporarily abandoning the mission to hit new record highs.
Moreover, Bitcoin revisited $30,000but has managed to avert losses to $25,000 as predictedon Thursday. The rest of the market is still painted red apart from some selected tokens such as Curve Dao, which ignored the bearish wave to post double-digit gains.
Bitcoin on the verge of a technical upswing to $40,000
The pioneer cryptocurrency has resumed the uptrend from the support at $30,000. It is exchanging hands slightly above $31,000, while bulls work tooth-and-nail to regain control over the price.
The bullish outlookto $40,000 is likely to be validated by the formation of a double-bottom pattern. This pattern is bullish and is created after the price tests a lower level twice.
A double bottom pattern identifies a precise entry point and gives an exact target; in this case, BTC/USD is likely to hit $40,000.
Similarly, the Relative Strength Index is rebounding from the oversold area. Further action toward the midline will signal a growing bullish grip. Closing the day above the 200 SMA on the 4-hour chart will add credence to the anticipated upswing.
BTC/USD 4-hour chart
It is worth noting that the spike in price to $40,000 will fail to occur if the 200 SMA hurdle remains unshaken. On the downside, losses under $30,000 could validate the bearish call to $25,000.
Ethereum must break the $1,200 barrier to save upswing to record highs
Ethereum had curved a path to new all-time highs earlier this week by rising to $1,440. Most analysts believed that Ether would rest above $1,800 before the launch of CME ETH futures on February 8 Besides, a Fundstrat analyst recently predicted that Ethereum is heading to $10,500 by the end of 2021.
While the rally was cut short by the declines touching $1,045, Ethereum seems to be regaining momentum. At the time of writing, the price is trading at $1,164. On the upside, resistance is expected at the 100 SMA ($1,200). Ether must overcome this hurdle to pave the way for further gains and reinstate the mission to $1,800.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
On the other hand, ETH/USDis not out of the woods yet. In case the seller congestion at $1,200 stays put, a breakdown would come into the picture and perhaps push Ethereum to the short-term support at $1,100. If push comes to shove and sellers start panic selling, we can expect Ethereum to extend the losses to $900.
Ripples recovery is an uphill battle
Ripple
swung out of consolidation as predictedbut ended up in a breakdown that saw it refresh levels under $0.25. A reversal came into play, but its upside is capped under $0.27.
Meanwhile, XRP is trading at 0.265 amid more sideways trading action. Recovery back to $0.3 is unlikely to come easy, especially with the resistance at the 50 SMA, the 100 SMAand the 200 SMA on the 4-hour chart.
The leveling RSI has reinforced the prevailing sideways trading. However, if XRP breaks above $0.27, gains to $0.3 may begin to materialize.
XRP/USD 4-hour chart
Support at $0.25 remains key to XRPs recovery mission and must be defended at all costs. If broken, declines will target $0.2 and $0.17 (December low), respectively.

Ethereum price rose to $ 420 thousand on January 19, setting the record. Crypto money analysis company Santiment announced that after the ATH seen, addresses holding more than 10 thousand ether have risen. The company said eth could see sales pressure.
Before Ethereum was 420 dollars, the number of addresses holding more than 10 thousand Eth was 211 thousand. According to Santiment, the number of these addresses increased to 225 thousand with the price record.
However, the number of addresses holding over a thousand ether fell to the lowest level in the last 3 years and reached 6,877.
High selling pressure expected
Santiment discussed in his article whether the price of ethereum peaked or not. Underlining that ether data are not yet clear, the company said ether could see a short-term price drop.
In addition, social metrics increased with the increase in ethereum price. Since January 12, the search rate of ethereum in social networks has increased. It was also noted that although there has been a bounce in the amount of ether (Exchange Inflow) flowing to the stock markets, it is still in a downward trend. The reason for this was the possibility of selling pressure.
Expressing that sales in ethereum have decreased similar to Bitcoin, Santiment interpreted this as an indication that investors are waiting for the peak. Continuing this expectation may result in the price falling before a new peak is seen.
The supply of ether in the stock markets is rising
In the article, it was stated that the ethereum supply in the stock markets has decreased for a while, but the supply has started to increase with the price increase in recent days. It has been said that the upward movement seen, although not a big increase, may open up space for sales.
Announced How He Lost All Ethereums In 100 Seconds
The supply of ethereum in the stock exchanges has reached the highest level of the last week. There will definitely be sales pressure in Ethereum. 
It was shown that the MVRV score obtained by collecting the prices of the circulating cryptocurrencies on the date of purchase indicates that the ethereum is in a dangerous area. Santiment interpreted this data as the most dangerous data and therefore said there is a possibility that the price may move down. Finally, Santiment stated that miners were selling high volumes and emphasized that ethereum could see a decrease in the short term.

The price of the worlds second largest cryptocurrency, ether, hit a new all-time highof US$1,440 (1,050) on January 19. This breached a previous high set three years ago and gave ether a total value (market capitalisation) of US$160 billion, although it has since fallen backto around US$140 billion.
Ether, which runs on a technology system known as the ethereum blockchain, is worth over ten times the price it was when it bottomed during the COVID market panic of March 2020. And the cryptocurrency is still only five years old. In part, this remarkable rise in the value is due to excess money flowinginto all the leading cryptocurrencies, which are now seen as relatively safe store-of-value assets and a good speculative investment.
Ether/US$ price
TradingView
But ethers price rise has even outstripped that of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, which only had a seven-fold increase since March. Ether has outperformed partly due to several improvements and new features being rolled out over the next few months. So what are ether and ethereum and why is this cryptocurrency now worth more thancorporate giants such as Starbucks and AstraZeneca?
Ether and bitcoin
Blockchains are online ledgers that keep permanent tamper-proof records of information. These records are continually verified by a network of computer nodes similar to servers, which are not centrally controlled by anyone. Ether is just one of over 8,000 cryptocurrencies that use some form of this technology, which was invented by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto when he released bitcoinover a decade ago.
The ethereum blockchain was first outlinedin 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a 19-year old prodigy who was born in Russia but mostly grew up in Canada. After crowdfunding and development in 2014, the platform was launched in July 2015.
As with the bitcoin blockchain, each ethereum transaction is confirmed when the nodes on the network reach a consensus that it took place  these verifiers are rewarded in ether for their work, in a process known as mining.
But the bitcoin blockchain is confined to enabling digital, decentralised money  meaning money that is not issued from any central institution unlike, say, dollars. Ethereums blockchain is categorically different in that it can host both other digital tokens or coins, and decentralised applications.
Decentralised applications or dapps are open-source programs developed by communities of coders not attached to any company. Any changes to the software are voted on by the community using a consensus mechanism.
Perhaps the best known applications running on the ethereum blockchain are smart contracts, which are programs that automatically execute all or parts of an agreement when certain conditions are met. For instance, a smart contract could automatically reimburse a customer if, say, a flight was delayed more than a prescribed amount of time.
Many of the dapp communities are also operating what is known as decentralised autonomous organisationsor DAOs. These are essentially alternatives to companies and seen by many as the building blocks of the next phase of the internet or 
web 3.0
. A good example is the burgeoning trading exchange Sushiswap
Ethereum has evolved and developed since its launch six years ago. In 2016, a set of smart contracts known as The DAO raised a recordUS$150 million in a crowdsale but was quickly exploited by a hacker who siphoned off one- third of the funds. However, since then, the ethereum ecosystem has matured considerably. While hacks and scams remain common, the overall level of professionalism appears to have improved dramatically.
Why the price explosion
Financial interest in ether tends to follow in the wake of bitcoin rallies because it is the second-largest cryptocurrency and, as such, quickly draws the attention of the novice investor. All the same, there are other factors behind its recent rally.
The first is the pace of innovation on the platform. Most activity in the cryptocurrency space happens on ethereum. In 2020, we saw the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi) DeFi is analogous to the mainstream financial world, but with the middleman banks cut out.
Users can borrow, trade, lend and invest through autonomous smart contracts via protocols like Compound Aaveand Yearn Finance It sounds like science fiction, but this is no hypothetical market  approximately US$24 billionis locked into various DeFi projects right now. Importantly, DeFi allows users to generate income on their cryptocurrency holdings, especially their ether tokens.
The second factor behind the ether surge is the launch of ethereum 2.0 This upgrade addresses major concerns impacting the current version of ethereum. In particular, it will reduce transaction fees especially useful in DeFi trading, where each transaction can end up costing the equivalent of tens of US dollars.
Ethereum 2.0 will also eliminate the environmentally wasteful mining currently required to make the ethereum blockchain function (the same is true of many other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin). Within the year, ethereum should be able to drop the need for vast industrial mining warehouses that consume huge amounts of energy.
Instead, transactions will be validated using a different system known as 
proof-of-stake
. The sense that ethereum addresses problems like these quickly rather than letting them sit could prove a major differential from the sometimes sluggish and conservative pace of the bitcoin development culture.
A final factor is the launch of ethereum futurestrading on February 8. This means that traders will be able to speculate on what ether will be worth at a given date in the future for the first time  a hallmark of any mature financial asset. Some analysts have saidthe recent bitcoin rally has been fuelled by traditional investment firms, and the launch of ethereum futures is often touted as opening the doors for the same price action.
However, as every seasoned cryptocurrency user knows, both currencies are extremely volatile and are as liable to crash by extremes as rise by them. Bitcoins price fell85% in the year after the last bull market in 2017, while ether was downby 95% at one stage from its previous high of US$1,428.
Whatever the valuation, the future of ethereum as a platform looks bright. Its challenge is ultimately external: projects such as Cardanoand Polkadot created by individuals who helped launch ethereum itself, are attempting to steal ethereums crown.
But as bitcoin has shown, first-mover advantage matters in cryptocurrency, and despite bitcoins relative lack of features it is unlikely to be moved from its dominant position for some time. The same is most likely true for the foreseeable future with ethereum.",2021-01-21,0.9976,0.112,0.037,0.851
"Moonbeam upgrades Polkadot smart contract platform to include staking
Moonbeam introduces a staking mechanism and adds significant infrastructure and user experience improvements...
Published by
CryptoNinjas.net
01/21/2021
Moonbeam, an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Polkadot announced today a new version of its TestNet, Moonbase Alpha. This latest version introduces significant infrastructure updates and adds staking features, opening the door for collators that actively participate in producing blocks on the network. This update is an essential step toward the launch of Moonriver, the networks Kusama deployment, which is currently expected in late March 2021.
An Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam makes it easy to create multi-chain applications. By minimizing the changes required to run existing Solidity smart contracts, Ethereum devs can replicate their dApps and implement them on Moonbeam using familiar developer tools like MetaMask, Truffle, Remix, among others.
Staking
The staking mechanism being introduced  for testing and development purposes only  powers the selection of collators and protocol level rewards for providing collation services to the network. The Moonbeam team continues to work on other technical improvements designed to make it easier for Ethereum based projects to expand to Polkadot:
Improvement in the gas computation.
Support for querying pending transactions while they are yet to be processed.
Queries that accept multiple addresses for past events.
Infrastructure
Moonbase Alpha v5 also includes significant improvements to the TestNet infrastructure. It can now support externally accessible full nodes and collators, enabling partners and users to participate in the network directly. Additionally, it also includes improvements to the quality of the code, standardization of libraries, and optimizations, making it 15-50 times faster than the previous version.
The Alpha was created for development purposes; the engineering team will continue to develop and improve it. More information on Moonbase Alpha, including the features currently available, can be found on the project documentation site",2021-01-21,0.9936,0.172,0.006,0.823

Bitcoin reacts to a symmetrical triangle pattern formation, with declines eyeing $25,000.
Ethereum on the verge of a breakdown to $1.200 and $1,100, mainly if ascending parallel channel support breaks.
Ripple in consolidation but could dive to $0.25 if it closes the day below the 50 SMA.
Joe Biden's inaugurationis behind uswithout any hitches, althoughformer President Donald Trump skipped the national event. Bitcoinand the rest of the cryptocurrency market remained relatively quiet apart from Wednesday morning dip. A minor drop saw BTC refresh the support at $34,000, allowing Grayscale Investments to top up its holdings by 8,000 BTC
At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market is turning bearish fast with selected assets such as Ethereum, Aaveand Cosmos sliding by 7%, 10%and 10% in that order. Similarly, Bitcoin appears to be hunting for another bottom (higher) before it makes the great move above $40,000 again.
Bitcoin bearish outlook returns
BTC/USD is in the process of confirming a symmetrical triangle breakdown. The 4-hour chart shows the chart pattern's formation with converging trendlines that link a series of sequential peaks and troughs.
Generally, the trendlines are supposed to cross at an approximately equal point referred to as the apex. Symmetrical triangle patterns highlight periods of consolidation ahead of either a breakout or a breakdown.
It helps to note that a breakdown occurs from the ascending trendline and identifies the beginning of a downtrend. On the other hand, a breakout happens at the descending trendline and signifies the start of a bullish trend.
Symmetrical triangles have precise price targets for the breakout or breakdown, mainly measured from the highest point to the pattern's lowest point. For instance, if the chart's breakdown confirms, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a downswing to $25,000.
BTC/USD 4-hour chart
. The next tentative support is $32,000 and the 200 Simple Moving Average. Other vital levels to keep in mind are $30,000 and $28,000.
Ethereum testing crucial support as declines linger
Ethereum has been caught in a bearish gust of wind sweeping across the cryptocurrency market. The seemingly massive overhead pressure comes barely 48 hours after Ethereum hit a record high at $1,446.
In the meantime, the least resistance path is downwards, especially after Ether lost the ascending channel's middle boundary support. For now, attention has been turned to defending the channel's lower edge and the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart.
If push comes to shove and the bearish leg overshoots the above crucial levels, Ethereum is likely to refresh the 200 SMA at $1,200.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, adds credence to the pessimistic outlook.
This technical indicator traces the path of a trend and measures its momentum. It has turned bearish at writing with the 12-day exponential moving average crossing under the 26-day exponential moving average. The odds for a bearish impulse have increased significantly.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
The optimistic outlook discussed earlierwill be viable if Ethereum holds above the 50 SMA. Price action beyond the channel's middle boundary would call for more buy orders, pulling ETH toward new all-time highs at $1,400.
Ripple consolidation nears breaking point
XRP is trading at $0.284 after losing support at the 100 SMA. Overhead pressure is bound to increase in the near term, especially with the price dancing beneath the Bollinger bands middle boundary.
The Relative Strength Index is sliding under the midline and could validate the downtrend, eyeing $0.25. Realize that as the Bollinger bandssqueeze, a breakout or breakdown draws nigh.
XRP/USD 4-hour chart
The bearish outlook would be thrown out the window if Ripplereclaimed the ground above the confluence established by the 50 SMA, the 100 SMAand the Bollinger band middle boundary. XRP will remain in the woods and susceptible to losses as long as it trades under $0.3.

Ethereum prepares for liftoff to $1,700 ahead of the CME futures launch
The Ethereum CME futures launch will occur on February 8 and aims to empower investors with proper risk management. The derivatives have been ""developed by the leading, most diverse, and regulated marketplace"" and home to the renowned Bitcoin futuresand options.
The CME Ether futures will be cash-settled, meaning that they will be paid in cash and not the underlying asset. According to the predictionmade in December, for some analysts like Spencer Noon, ETH futures were long overdue.
CME launched Bitcoin futures in 2017 amid the bull cycle that saw the price close in on $20,000. However, the price action was not as remarkable as the 19% spike to $19,016 following CBOE Bitcoin futures' debut, just seven days earlier. Although investors expected a significant move in Bitcoin price the derivatives' launch on CME only pushed Bitcoin to $19,932 (former 2017 all-time).
BTC/USD 4-hour chart
On the contrary, the launch of Ethereum is the only major event in the ongoing bull unlikely to be diffused. Simultaneously, Ethereum has already broken out to a new all-time high and currently receives more investors' attention.
According to David Grider, an analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Ethereum can hit $10,500 by the end of 2021. The medium-term technical outlook points to highs of $3,000, as explained with on-chain metrics
In the meantime, Ethereum has retreated from the newly established all-time high in search of support at a higher low. A recent breakout above an ascending triangle stalled at $1,446. Ether appears to have tested the x-axis of the triangle twice, but its upside has been limited below $1,400.
The initial breakout above the pattern is still viable and impactful as long as the hypotenuse holds firmly. Besides, Ethereum is in a safe zone if it maintains in the region between $1,200 and $1,300. On the upside, the enormous altcoin eyes gain to $1,700 before launching the futures product on CME.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
On the other hand, IntoTheBlock's IOMAP model reveals that Ethereum has a relatively clear path to $1,400. However, attention must be channeled between $1,311 and $1,326, where roughly 221,000 addresses had previously purchased nearly 2 million ETH. On breaking above this area, Ethereum may rally to $1,400 first, then complete the leg up to $1,700.
Ethereum IOMAP chart
On the downside, the cryptoasset is sitting on an area with immense support, proposing that declines are unlikely in the short-term. The most robust support runs from $1,256 to $1,294. Here, roughly 123,000 addresses bought 6.6 million ETH. As long as this buyer congestion range remains intact, Ethereum bulls will have ample time to prepare for the upswing to $1,700.

Tether Use on Tron Passes Ethereum as Low Fees Attract Small Transactions
The number of tether transactions on the Tron blockchain have passed Ethereums count for three consecutive weeks as fees on the number two blockchain remain high.
Total weekly tethertransactions on Ethereum have held steady at around 1.5 million for the past four weeks. But on Tron, transactions per week have grown from roughly 900,000 in mid December to nearly 2 million the second week in January, per Coin Metricsdata.
This recent trend is primarily because of fees, said Coin Metrics analyst Nate Maddrey in a message to CoinDesk.

Priced in dollars, the average fee for an Ethereum transaction set a record high of above $19 a week ago, but now sits just below $8. Priced in ether the average fee is well below all-time highs but still rather large, surpassing 0.015 ETH multiple times this month, per data from Blockchair
As fees go up, [tether] transactions tend to shift from Ethereum to Tron, Maddrey said.
Notably, the total value of tether transacted on Ethereum is still larger than Tron, signaling that primarily smaller transactors are migrating. Meanwhile, parties executing larger transactions who can presumably afford higher fees seem comfortable continuing to use Ethereum.

Lately, given the increased cost of Ethereum transactions, it would be logical to use Tron, said Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, noting the newer blockchain also has good adoption across crypto exchanges and is extremely cheap compared to Ethereum.
Tron isnt the only alternative for tether users. In the past two years, Tether has also launched on Algorand Solanaand Liquid Networkwith plans for even more integrations, Ardoino said. But which network claims the largest share of Tether transactions is still somewhat of an open question.
Tether transactions skewing heavily toward just one or two blockchains wouldnt be surprising, Maddrey told CoinDesk. But the distribution of use depends on a combination of low fees, network effects, and usability.
Ardoino told CoinDesk that in a few years he expects Ethereum to still retain an important role for Tether thanks to the Ethereum 2.0 migration that should guarantee more throughput.
He also expects other blockchains to get a fair share of the total throughput, however.

Polkadot price overview: Polkadot price across the last ten days
Polkadot
price had a slow start to 2021 as the price kept trading with significantly low volatility. It was not until January 13 when the price broke above the $10.00 level, rising rapidly to the $15.00 level. The sharp movement caused the price to observe a correction to the $12.50 mark, but the strong bullish pressure was still present.
Subsequently, the price continued rising and rose to $17.50 before meeting strong resistance. Since then, the Polkadot price hovered below the markuntil yesterday when the price fell below the $16.00 level. Today the price found support at $15.00, but it is uncertain whether DOTwill hold out above the level.
Technical indicators
Across the technical indicators, the MACD shows bearish momentum that seems to be increasing, as highlighted by the increasing size of the histogram. The two EMAs continue to diverge further as DOTcontinues its descent. The indicator may suggest a bullish reversal if the DOTprice holds above the $15.00 mark.
The RSI is still neutral and does not issue any signals, and the indicator is returning towards the mean position at 50.00. The indicators neutral position shows room for movement in either direction, while the incline suggests increasing bullish pressure in the markets.
The Bollinger bands are expanding downwards, suggesting increasing price volatility for DOTin the short term. The indicator shows increasing bearish momentum with potential for movement below the $15.00 mark.
The four-hour technical analysis issues a buy signal with 12 of the twenty major technical indicators supporting a bullish movement. However, the signal is not very strong as eight indicators are issuing sell signals while another eight indicators remain neutral.
The 24-hour technical analysis shares this bullish sentiment with 14 indicators suggesting a bullish rise. The buy signal is stronger than the four-hour analysis as only four indicators are issuing sell signals while eight remain neutral.
What to expect from Polkadot price?
Traders should expect Polkadot price to break above the $16.00 mark, with the price expected to retest $17.50 in the coming days. The positive technical analysis confirms this prediction suggesting an increasing bullish momentum in the coming hours.
Conversely, if Polkadot price falls below the $15.00 level, the asset would start a bearish rally causing the price to fall to the $12.50 level. Further downwards movement may mean a fall to the $10,000 level.

"ETH has broken its previous ATH.
DeFi and network upgrades fuel its rise.
The general crypto market has had a moderate past week, but Ethereum seems to be having quite a good time as it enjoys a touch-and-go moment with the previous ATH. Merely 24 hours ago, the second largest crypto (by market cap) surpassed its ATH, establishing a new highof $1,432. According to information on CoinMarketCap ETHhas had a 22% price spike in the last 7 days.
ETH
has impressed many people, leading some investors to offer highly confident predictions about its future. A recent statement by a strategist working with Fundstrat Global Advisors claimed that Ethereum is headed for a price over $10k. The strategist, David Grider, put the price at around $10,500. However, he refrained from giving an actual time-frame for the prediction.

Ethereum could spike by 7x
The mentioned $10,500 in price for ETHrepresents an over sevenfold spike, something even Bitcoin has found hard to achieve. In fact, the crypto performed much better compared to Bitcoin in 2020. While Bitcoin scored a 4x price upswing, ETHscored 5x. The crypto is now trading at around $1,292.
With the most recent price action breaking the ATH record that has been in place since the end of the last bull cycle of late 2017, its easy to see why a lot of investors are bullish on Ethereum. Many have already accepted the fact that Ethereum has matured into a credible asset class worthy of mainstream attention. Institutional investors like Grayscale are already accumulating ETHalong with BTC
DeFi and network upgrade support ETH popularity
According to Grider, blockchain technology will revolutionize cloud computing. He also said that Ethereum represents the best option for crypto investments when gauging its risks and rewards. The Ethereum blockchain has had a great boost from the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), with numerous such applications already running on its network.
The recent efforts to upgrade the network has also played a significant role in supporting the popularity of ETH With its faster processing speed, the network has attracted more DeFi protocols on its platform. The network can now process as many transactions as Visa and Mastercard.

Ethereum price was rejected at its all-time high of $1,440 and has significantly cooled off.
ETH miners have taken some profit in 2021 which could have contributed to the selling pressure.
Ethereum price reached $1,440 on Coinbase
, a new all-time high before plummeting to a low of $1,234. It seems that ETH miners have been selling a lot in the past few weeks as their balances have dropped below 1 million ETH for the first time since the price hit $1,000.
Ethereum price faces healthy correction and it'spoised for another leg up
Most of the selling pressure comes from ETH miners selling a significant amount of coins from January 3 until now. This can be concerning to the bulls in the short-term as miners could continue to panic sell if Ethereum price falls harder.
ETH Miners Balance
Additionally, the MVRV (30d) chartshows Ethereum is still close to the danger zone although this metric has cooled off with the last dip. The risk of accumulating ETH when the digital asset is close to the danger zone is certainly higher.
ETH MVRV (30d) chart
The recent sell-off from Ethereums all-time high happened right after the TD Sequential indicator presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick on the 4-hour chart. So far, ETH bulls have defended a crucial support level at $1,183.However, if this onebreaks, bears will take control of the trend.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
Ethereum has re-tested the previous resistance level of an ascending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. Considering that the SuperTrend has remained bullish, the digital assetcould be aiming for a high of $1,670 after a rebound.
ETH Holders Distribution
Its also important to note that despite miners are selling, whales arent. The number of large holders with 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins hasnt moved since January 15 and it has increased by two since January 6. Similarly, whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 have accumulated even more ETH since the beginning of 2021.

And just as bitcoins rapid ascent has spurred a new wave of lofty price predictions, analysts and investors in digital-asset markets immediately set about speculating on what comes next for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.
Ethereum will soon pass to the next level, the trader and analyst Alex Kruger
tweeted Tuesday
. Points to watch range from $1,500 to $2,750, he added.
The run already looks pretty impressive. Prices climbed nearly six-fold last year and have surged another 90% just in the first few weeks of 2021.

Ether is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, which is becoming increasingly significant in comparison to real-world analogues  including several big U.S. banks that sit at the hub of the traditional economy.
The price surge over the past few days has pushed the market value of all the existing ether in the world to about $160 billion. At that level, its larger than the U.S. financial behemoths Wells Fargo ($135 billion) and Citigroup ($132 billion) as well as the
Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley ($137 billion).
Bitcoins market value is about $644 billion, for what its worth.

The logical justification forcomparing the value with banks is that the Ethereum blockchain is the primary venue for development of decentralized finance. Known as DeFi, its a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are using open-source software to build semi-automated versions of lending and trading platforms atop blockchain networks. The theory is that they could someday replace or at least disrupt traditional financial firms.
The comparison isnt perfect, since Ethereum works more like a network for companies and developers to build upon rather than the companies themselves. But the exercise does point to the ecosystems no-longer-dismissable scale.
This is key for the value of ether, since the cryptocurrency is often used as collateral within DeFi protocols as well as used to pay fees on transactions over the Ethereum blockchain.
Collateral socked into DeFi protcols has soared to almost $25 billion, from about $700 million at the start of 2020, and even Brian Brooks, who stepped down last week as acting U.S. comptroller of the currency,
tweeted Tuesday
that DeFi might be scary to some today but necessary tomorrow as some banks start telling you what you can and cant do with your own money.
According to the industry tracker DappRadar, about 45% of 238 new decentralized applications in 2020 were designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain. The top 10 applications, known as Dapps, were responsible for 87% of transaction volumes on the blockchain, DappRadar wrote in a
recent report
.
DeFi development has been progressing rapidly, the blockchain-analysis firm Coin Metrics wrote Tuesday. Although institutions likely arent wading into DeFi at this stage, there may be growing interest from traditional finance investors drawn in by the technology.
The Ethereum ecosystem also has growing similarities with traditional fixed-income markets, especially now that the blockchain is transitioning toward a staking system, where new rules will reward investors with juicy yields for putting in the capital needed to assure network security. Theres even a growing demand for
bitcoin thats tokenized
to make it compatible with the Ethereum network, where the tokens can then be deposited into DeFi protocols in exchange for attractive interest rates.
And just as bitcoin has benefited from a wave of big institutional investors allocating money to the asset, a raft of headlines on ether could draw fresh interest from professional managers.
Changpeng CZ Zhao, CEO of Binance, the worlds biggest cryptocurrency exchange, wrote this week in a
quarterly report
that bitcoin works like a gateway for investors getting into the digital-asset ecosystem: People enter via bitcoin and will almost certainly eventually explore other things in the crypto space, he wrote.
The Chicago-based futures exchange CME, which helped make cryptocurrencies more accessible to traditional investors when it launched bitcoin futures trading in late 2017, announced in December that it plans to start
ether futures next month
.
This will give a more extensive base of institutional investors access to ETH exposure, the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm
Arcane Research
wrote Tuesday in a weekly note to clients.
There are risks, of course. Ether prices are even more volatile than those for the notoriously volatile bitcoin. And over the past year, as DeFi activity grew, the Ethereum network suffered from congestion and elevated transaction fees. Blockchain contenders have sprung up to challenge Ethereum, including Polkadot, Cardano and Binance Smart Chain, according to DappRadar.
Even so, Simon Peters, market analyst for the trading platform eToro, said Tuesday in emailed comments that hes impressed with the networks ability to hostdecentralized streaming applications, web browsers, video games, shared computing power services and digital art shops. In addition to DeFi.
This plethora of uses has contributed to Ethereums price rise, Peters wrote. As more Dapps are built on the Ethereum blockchain, its utility increases.
He said its very feasible that ether could hit $2,500 this year, as it benefits from the extended cryptoasset bull run we are currently seeing.
In that sense its just like bitcoin: A key use case for ether is speculation.

Investors ongoing appetite for bitcoin wasnt enough to prevent the top cryptocurrency by market value from slipping by over $2,600 on Wednesday.

While the cryptocurrency is down, its still within a week-long narrowing price range, as seen on the hourly price chart.
A move below the lower end of the triangle would expose support at $30,000.

Screenshots from the imToken wallet app showing the Tezos integration
imToken, Asias biggest walletfor Ethereum users and Chinas first self-custodial digital asset wallet, today deployed support for public blockchain Tezos. Tezos is the twelfth public chain officially supported by imToken. The other 11 public chains include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, EOS, Tron, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Nervos, Filecoin, and Kusama.
This latest public chain wallet integration demonstrates strong support for popular blockchain projects such as Tezos from imTokens 11 million users in more than 200 countries and regions around the world. The integration brings all the wallet features the Tezos community in Asia needs.
Supported wallet features listed below include managing digital assets, transacting, and baking:
Create a new Tezos account/address
Import & Backup Tezos account
View Tezos balance & transaction history
Send and receive tez
Delegate and undelegate tez
Watch baking yield and accrued tez
This integration with imToken not only continues the transformation of payment transactions, but also allows the community to continue building on and advancing the Tezos protocol.
 David Shin, Head of TZ APAC
Tezos + imToken
Unlike the high computational resources required by Bitcoin miners to secure the Bitcoin network, Tezos uses a consensus mechanism known as Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS) protocol to secure its network in a greener and more cost-effective way.
In blockchain technology, the PoS mechanism enables participants to reach consensus on the state of the blockchain at scale, minimizing the friction of counterparty risk and a single point of failure. Anyone can participate in the consensus process by holding a certain amount of the blockchain networks native cryptocurrency and setting up a blockchain node.
Through the integration, imToken wallet users are now able to help secure the Tezos network by delegating their tez, the native cryptocurrency of Tezos blockchain, to imToken and other popular validators within the Tezos ecosystem. These validators, known as bakers, are in charge of securing the Tezos network on the wallet users behalf.
Ethereum has been our focus from the beginning, but with PoS chains emerging in popularity for their lower transaction costs and energy-efficient usage, our users are asking for more PoS chains to try and use. With Tezos, we are excited to bring not only the original PoS chain, but one with a unique self-amending governance mechanism to integrate the latest technology. We are grateful to the developer support provided by the TZ APAC team during the integration process. We are looking forward to this long-term collaboration. Lets bake!
 Ben He, Chief Executive Officer of imToken
The Tezos integration with imToken is part of a rising global phenomenon of combining digital value storage in cryptocurrencies and transmitting them through digital wallets in a new era of programmable Internet money. PoS chains such as Tezos are enabling a new generation of financial networks and governance systems for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes and industries. These financial networks bring powerful network effects that reward their participants relative to the value they contribute in an auditable and decentralized manner.",2021-01-20,0.9942,0.122,0.022,0.857

Valid Points: Why Ethereum 2.0 Shifts How Investors Value ETH
What is the intrinsic value of ether?
This is a question Ive been wrestling with this past week as the etherprice set a new all-time high of $1,439.33, according to CoinDesks price index
Similar to how many view the current bitcoinprice bull run as being credibly different from previous cycles for reasons to do with greater institutional involvement and mainstream interest, among other reasons I get the sense that the valuation of ether by investors is being looked at this time around in a different light.
The primary reason for why I believe ethers valuation has shifted in fundamental ways this market cycle compared to previous ones is because this December Ethereum officially launched its parallel staking network, Ethereum 2.0

The daily average income of Ethereum 2.0 validators in terms of ETH has been on the slight decline since last week. According to BeaconScan average income has dropped over the month of January from 0.008063 ETH/day to 0.007768 ETH/day. In dollar terms, however, income has been on the rise given bullish price trends pushing the value of ETH up 66.03% year-to-date.
User participation on the Ethereum 2.0 network has also been increasing at a steady pace of close to 900 new validators each day. There are over 65,000 validators, each staking 32 ETH worth roughly $45,000, at time of writing. An additional 16,000 validators are in a holding queue for entry into the network over the next few weeks.
Because of the continued growth of new users on Eth 2.0, a greater percentage of total ether supply is getting locked away and becoming unusable on the original Ethereum blockchain. Roughly 2.4% of all ETH in circulation is now immovable from Eth 2.0. Some Ethereum investors believe this percentage will grow to be as high as 30%in the future.
Eth 2.0 Staking Rate (%)
Source:
CryptoQuant
A large percentage of total supply being removed from active circulation among decentralized applications (dapps) and transactions between users impacts the velocity of ether as a digital currency. Velocity is the rate or frequency at which units of a currency are exchanged in an economy, or in the case of Ethereum, in a blockchain system. If we think about ETH as money, ETHs velocity is negatively impacted as a result of Ethereum 2.0.
However, as certain Ethereum expertshave pointed out, ETH, unlike BTC, is much more than an asset for transfers of value, or even a store of value for that matter. ETH can be likened to a commodity asset needed for fueling a new decentralized web and financial system. ETH can also be viewed as a capital asset inextricably linked in value to the popularization and adoption of proof-of-stake blockchain protocols.
With the advent of Ethereum 2.0, long-term holdings in ETH represent long-term bets on the decentralized web and/or finance, as well as the viability, scalability and security of proof-of-stake blockchains to the same, if not higher degree, than proof-of-work blockchains.
There are a number of other use cases for Ethereums native crypto asset, ether, besides its use as payment for decentralized applications and staking on Ethereum 2.0. However, these are two that are likely to continue motivating investments in ETH as Ethereum 2.0 development advances.

Mining is a nuisance to many Ethereum fans, which is why itll slowly be phased out with Eth 2.0.
A new mining algorithm called Programmatic Proof-of-Work (ProgPoW) sparked life into this conversation before the February 2019 Constantinople hard fork. ProgPow would have made it easier for small miners to participate in the mining game. Yet, it ultimately failed to be implemented. Its failure now stands as a lesson in how to do decentralized governance.

"While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeking reliable support levels, a crucial price dynamicindicator, All Exchanges Stablecoin Reserves, breaks above historic highs.
Stablecoin reserves on allexchanges surpass $4.16 billion
Accordng to the latest tweet by top-notch Korean on-chain analysts Cryptoquant, centralized exchanges havewitnessed new all-time highs for a crucial trading indicator. The massive inflow of stablecoins over the last few days has brought this metric to $4,163,993,000 for the first time in history.

Twitter
It is interesting that the previouslocal high was registered shortly after Bitcoin's (BTC) all-timehigh over $42,000 on Jan. 4. Meanwhile, there isno strong positive correlation between the All Exchanges Stablecoin Reserves and Bitcoin (BTC) price.
Two metrics used to surge hand-in-hand during the first stages of the ongoing crypto rally. However, when Bitcoin (BTC) was rejected from its latest high, the supply of stablecoins continued to surge.
Since the start of the 2020 crypto bull run, this metric added 73 percent in less than two months.

Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Bitcoin sits on the launchpad to $42,000, as crypto bull cycle pauses
|
39 minutes ago
Bitcoin sits onto support at $32,000 amid a collective push to jumpstart the uptrend to $42,000.
Ethereum is having a difficult time staying above $1,300 despite investors decision to hold their tokens.
Ripple continues to lose support levels mainly due to the growing resistance at $0.3.
The cryptocurrency market is a sea of red apart from a few selected altcoins Ethereum appears to have slowed down the breakout to $3,000 after hitting a new all-time high barrier.
Ripple
is stuck in consolidation, as a breakout above $0.3 becomes a pipe dream. On the other hand, Bitcoin is trading slightly under $32,000 while holding firmly to $31,000.
The altcoins that have managed to ignore the bearish wave include THETA with 16% in gains over the last 24 hours, Solana up 10%and Decred up 15%.
Bitcoin needs this critical support to jumpstart the uptrend
Bitcoin price
is depending on holding the crucial support at $31,000 to restart the uptrend. As covered earlier holders are hopeful that Bitcoin will lift off again, hence holding longer. Whales with at least 1,000 BTC have increased significantly in January, a bullish signal for the pioneer cryptocurrency.
Meanwhile, BTC is trading at $31,916 amid the push to settle above $32,000. The 200 Simple Moving Average on the 4-hour could absorb some of the selling pressure. Moreover, a break above the stubborn resistance at $34,500 could see the fear of missing out (FOMO) return to the market as investors extend their gaze to $42,000.
BTC/USD 4-hour chart
It is worth mentioning that Bitcoin will abandon the coveted recovery if support at $31,000 fails to hold. Similarly, another break under $30,000 could trigger panic selling among investors, as they cash out for profit. Lower support areas are envisaged at $25,000 and $22,000, respectively.
Ethereums upswing to $3,000 in jeopardy
Ethereum struggles to hold above $1,300 after the rejection from the all-time high, roughly at $1,481. The 50 Simple Moving Average has reinforced the immediate support on the 4-hour chart
ETH must defend this support at all costs. Otherwise, an extended breakdown could come into the picture. The 100 SMA is in line to absorb the selling pressure, but the overhead pressure under $1,300 is likely to intensify, pushing ETH to $1,200. Note that Ethereum is not out of the woods yet and could retest areas close to $1,000.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
Keeping the price above this zone may be the only way for Ether to sustain the expected uptrend to $3,000. The other two levels that must come down are $1,400 and $1,500, which will validate the uptrend. Ethereum holders, as discussed earlier are planning on keeping their bags full, which is a very bullish signal.
Are Ripple bulls running out of options?
XRP has been stuck in consolidation for quite a while. There have been instances where the price has stepped above $0.3, but the uptrend was unsustainable.
For now, Ripple is trading at $0.266 after rejection at the 200 SMA. Recovery is a hard nut to crack due to the multiple hurdles, including the 50 SMA at $0.28, the 100 SMA, and $0.3.
Holding above $0.26 will ensure that potential losses to $0.24 are averted. Note that XRP bulls are getting exhausted and discouraged the more prolonged the price stays in consolidation as well as under $0.3.
XRP/USD 4-hour chart
The Relative Strength Index brings to light the ongoing sideways price action. A break above the midline would call for more buy orders, perhaps create enough force to boost XRP above $0.3. Recovery to $0.4 seems a farfetched idea based on the current technical picture. Still, trading beyond $0.3 will raise investor confidence in the cross-border tokens ability to rally to new yearly highs.

ETH/USD: Can Ethereum keep rising after setting the all-time high?
Last Saturday, the Ethereum (ETH) price consolidated in the area of average prices. On Sunday night, buyers managed to form a bullish impulse, which restored the Ether price to the resistance area of $1,350.The bulls broke through this level tonight, renewing the all-time high at $1,476.
ETH/USD chart by TradingView
Ethereum (ETH) has managed to gain a foothold in the high zone, which means thatthe bullish run may continue to the area of $1,530. If in the zone of the maximum, the volumes of sales begin to grow, then the price will return to the support of $1,250.
On the bigger chart, Ethereum (ETH) might face a correction as the market share of Bitcoin (BTC) is about to rise in the short-term scenario. This will affectthe growth of the altcoinsmarket.

Ethereum price gears up for $3,000 as most indicators turn bullish
The Eth2 deposit contract continues to receive more Ethereum. At the time of writing, it holds around 2.83 million ETH worth over $4 billion at current prices. This is a significant number of Ethereum coins that are locked and cannot be sold.
ETH coins locked
In addition to the 2.83 million ETH locked inside Eth2, there are also 7 million ETH locked across DeFi protocols and projects, which means close to 10 million ETH are currently not truly in circulation, increasing its scarcity significantly, and therefore, bullish pressure.
ETH Transactions chart
One of the main strengths of Ethereum during this run has been a massive increase in the number of transactions in the past several months. The digital asset has reached a 7-day average of 1.15 million transactions, which is almost higher than its peak of transactions in January 2018.
Ethereum exchange Netflow
On January 22, 2021, Ethereum saw a colossal spike in the number of coins withdrawn from exchanges. Around 659,000 ETH left exchanges in just a single hour, which is the largest amount ever and indicates traders and investors are not interested in selling the digital asset currently.
Ethereum supply on exchanges chart
Although this kind of spikes is not common, the total number of ETH inside exchanges has been declining since March 2020, from a high of 27% of Ethereum to only 20.8% currently, a notable decay. This is a key aspect that should allow Ethereum price to continue rising as demand quickly outpaces supply scarcity.
Total Value Locked chart
The DeFi industry has seen a tremendous surge of money in the past few weeks, from $15.4 billion on December 31, 2020, to a current all-time high of $26.5 billion. Considering that around 90% of all DeFi projects are built on
this metric shows how fast the ecosystem is growing, and its undoubtedly bullish for ETH.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
However, despite all the positive indicatorsand on-chain metrics in favor of Ethereum, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on the 4-hour chart which, in the past, has proven to be a reliable call.

Bitcoin has held above $30K, showing a 5% increase at the beginning of the new working week, and is trading around $34K. The benchmark cryptocurrency is avoiding sharp moves, and large investors may take a pause, waiting for new triggers. Technical indicatorsconfirm the moderate price momentum. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies is in the greed mode, but so far in reasonable form. The RSI index on the daily chart is also far from the overbought condition. Thus, there are no obstacles for growth on the technical side, but for now, all participants can be extra cautious.
Bitcoin owes its historical highs to institutional investors who are now expected to make moves that could create momentum for the whole market. U.S. regulators are likely to take at least a neutral stance on cryptocurrencies. MicroStrategy considers Bitcoin pricelevels around $32K to be acceptable to buy. Nevertheless, buying $10 million worth of Bitcoin is not enough to create momentum right now. We will likely see similar buying decisions for relatively small amounts that aim to create a more positive news backdrop around cryptocurrencies.
Ethereum (ETH) is enjoying the most significant growth among the leading cryptocurrencies right now. The main altcoinhas increased by more than 8% in the last 24 hours and is trading above $1,400. If the coin manages to stay above the historical maximum or confidently continues its growth, we will see new momentum for ETH and other top altcoins. The developers' progress on the transition to the second version of the project, as well as the upcoming launch of futures on the CME in early February has a very positive effect on the coin's value.
U.S. President Joe Biden appointed Gary Gensler to head the SEC. At the very least, Gensler is not considered an opponent of cryptocurrencies. While he has been optimistic about the crypto sector in general, he has also stated that XRP and Ethereum can be regarded as securities. Whatever Gensler's personal stance, you have to understand that he will be making decisions within the system following the general political course, which has many components in the U.S.
Right now, the institutional crypto-machine is just gaining momentum. If regulators don't stop it, growth of the crypto sector will be imminent. Hardly anyone in the world of big capital would voluntarily give up the opportunity to make huge profits from investing in cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, in Libra's example, we have seen that when there is political will and the threat of systemic risks, prohibitive decisions regarding even the largest projects are swift.

Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, notched a new all-time high of $1,476 early Monday morning. The cryptocurrency climbed 6.2% to a price of $1,415 at about 9:15 a.m. ET.
Altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, have been known to rally in times of strength for bitcoin. Ether's latest price movement was attributed to increased use of Ethereum  its underlying network that is undergoing a major upgrade and interest from institutional investors in crypto.
""Ethereum's current rise cold shoulders the sceptics, many of whom were quick to denounce crypto when bitcoin recently fell from its $40,000 high,"" said Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst at online investment platform eToro.
""With a whole range of logistical improvements to the Ethereum network in the works, increased institutional inflows, and more and more developers building on the platform, the future is bright for Ethereum. I believe that a price of $2,500 by the end of the year is very feasible. As with all crypto, however, there will be bumps along the way.""

Market moves
Bitcoin is coming off its worst week in almost five months, but the main takeaway, according to veteran digital-market traders and analysts, is that it wasnt really all that bad.
A quick glance at price charts shows that declines at least as large as last weeks 9.9% retreat have happened nine times in the past two years.
And the cryptocurrencys price has risen so dramatically and consistently over the period that those prior corrections almost look quaint. The worst sell-off in recent memory was the 33.5% weekly plunge in March 2020, when the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus became clear to global investors. But in absolute dollar terms, that $2,690 drop was less than last weeks $3,950 loss, showing just how far bitcoins price has climbed since then.
According to Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, buyers appeared to materialize last week whenever prices fell to about $30,000. Thats just above the $29,112 level where bitcoin started off the year, following a 2020 when it quadrupled in price.
While 10%+ drawdowns shake conviction, these moves have been met with strong bids, Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, told clients Friday in a note. Shaking out profit takers and weak hands is necessary for BTC to make strides upwards.

According to Chainalysis, a blockchain-analysis firm, bitcoins recent rally to new record highs above $40,000 may have been too much to resist for speculators who have only recently nosed into the cryptocurrency arena, lured by the outsize returns of recent years.
New buyer behavior is still a major source of medium-term price volatility and is currently elevated, Philip Gradwell, chief economist for New York-based Chainalysis, wrote Friday. It is important to restate that the bitcoin price is still at historically very high levels.
Ryan Selkis, CEO of the digital-markets analysis firm Messari, wrote that last weeks tumble looked like a nice little dip for new buyers, and a wealth transfer from some of the weakest-handed sellers Ive seen in crypto to those with an actual investment thesis.
Data extracted from the bitcoin blockchain network show the number of addresses with at least 1,000 or more bitcoins increased last week  an indication that large institutional buyers may have been stepping into the market as prices dipped, CoinDesks Muyao Shen
reported Friday
.
The buying pressure seen in the lower bounds of the current range have been solid, Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, told clients early Monday in a note. The selling pressure above is in no way weaker. If bulls manage to break out, though, the move to the next level ($34,855) could be explosive and even take us further, back to the upper $38Ks.
The upshot? Further downside might still be in store, but the limited scope of last weeks price decline reveals plenty of demand for bitcoin at levels well above prices that prevailed in 2020.

The bitcoin market is showing signs of weakening demand from U.S.-based institutions, according to Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital.
Comparing bitcoins price moves during Asia daytime hours and American hours (split into 12 hours each) shows a clear pattern of relentless buying during the North American trading hours and selling in Asia, mainly by large investors (known as whales) and cryptocurrency miners.
The pattern emerged following the March 2020 price crash and had endured until two weeks ago when bitcoin reached record highs above $41,900. Since then, the strength during U.S. hours has lost momentum, QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.
The flat-to-negative Coinbase Premium  the spread between Coinbases BTC/USD pair and Binances BTC/USDT pair, which includes the stablecoin tether also suggests absence of strong demand from high-net-worth individuals and institutions.
Ill keep my bearish bias until there are significant Coinbase premium and Coinbase outflow, Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted on Sunday. BTC needs [U.S. dollar] spot inflows from institutional investors to start the next bull run.
As such, odds appear stacked against the cryptocurrency keeping gains above $33,000.

Ethereum-Based ConsenSys Quorum Partners With Chinas BSN Blockchain
New York-based Ethereum hub ConsenSys has partnered with the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) to bring its enterprise ledger, Quorum, to Chinas nationwide blockchain project.
As part of the partnership, announced Monday, ConsenSys Quorum, an open-source protocol layer that serves as a foundation for businesses to build Ethereum-based applications, will be available in about 80 different cities through BSNs public city nodes throughout mainland China.
China is a great example of where enterprise blockchain is a strong play, said Charles dHaussy, director of strategic initiatives and ConsenSys man in Hong Kong. What Ethereum is doing with ConsenSys Quorum is connecting people who are essentially migrating from the permissioned chain to the global chain.

Its a plum announcement for Quorum, the privacy-centric blockchain originally designed by engineers from JPMorgan. Quorum appeared to be in the wilderness for a time, between being spun out of the bank and re-housed within the ConsenSys ecosystem.
Quorum was very much associated with JPMorgan, but there was also this open-source software which was available to many developers, said dHaussy in an interview. It may not have been apparent, but there was this large audience of enterprise users, and we are now bringing to this ecosystem other products and applications from ConsenSys.

The BSN was founded in April 2020 by Red Date Technology, a Beijing-based software company, China UnionPay and China Mobile. BSN spans various cloud environments and portals in China (Quorum is already integrated with Alibaba Cloud), and is also backed by the Chinese government in the form of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), an economic planning agency.
Designed to be the backbone of the so-called Digital Silk Road, BSN has so far deployed 108 public city nodes, connecting over 80 cities across mainland China and eight public city nodes in other countries around the world, according to a press statement.
After the launch, BSN will include Quorum in BSNs training programs in 2021 to substantially accelerate the enterprise adoption of blockchain technology and Ethereum-based solutions in China, Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology and the executive director of BSN Development Association, said in a statement.
GoQuorum will also be interoperable with other permissioned frameworks and open permissioned frameworks on BSN, He said, building the blockchain cornerstone for the new infrastructure in China.

Summing up, dHaussy pointed out permissioned blockchain was the obvious start of the journey for many large firms but that commercially these networks are extremely hard to get off the ground.
Enterprise blockchain has been given strong support from the government in China and the tech is a good fit for the countrys sprawling manufacturing landscape, he said.
Chinas industries, which are a global network of large and small suppliers, are not integrated as they were in the past, said dHaussy. They are jumping on coordination tools such as blockchain.

ETH total value inETH 2.0 contract hits new ATH
The zero phase of the Ethereum 2.0 launch started in December last year and continues successfully. It started with a minimum of 524,288 ETH staked in the ETH deposit contract, when each staker had to send in a minimum of 32 ETH). ETH 2.0 is about switching from the proof of work (PoW) to the proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, in which the reward of the staker will depend on how much ETH theyput in.
However, the amount of ETH locked in the contract by stakers kept growing.
On Jan.24, popular analytics agency Glassnode shared that the amount of Ethers locked in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract had spiked to a new all-time high of 2,815,714 ETH.

Phase 0 of the ETH 2.0 rollout willbe followed by Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is expected to kick off at some point later this year.
Upcoming launch of Ethereum futures for institutions on CME
At the end of 2020, CME, a Chicago-based platform that works with institutional customers, made an announcement to launch Ethereum-based futures on Feb.8.
CME and CBOE were the first platforms to offer Bitcoin futures to institutional players in December 2017. This opened the gate for financial institutions to start investing in crypto. However, ironically, the crypto market dived into the long-lasting ""crypto winter""right after that.

"ETH/USD awaits a fresh catalyst for the next push higher.
The No. 2 coin wavers in a rising channel on the daily chart.
Bulls need to crack $1275; 21-DMA guards the downside.
ETH/USD
trades strongly bid, holding onto the $1200 level so far this Sunday, having closed Saturday modestly flat.
The worlds second-largest cryptocurrency fell sharply from the record highs of $1440 and hit nine-day lows at $1040 last week. The decline followed the former FedChair Yellens comments, citing that cryptocurrencies are mainly used for illegal activities.
Yellen, USTreasury Secretary nominee said: Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern. I think many are used - at least in a transaction sense - mainly for illicit financing. And I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn't occur through those channels.
Note that Ethereum has almost doubled its price since the start of this year from around $750 to break above the $1400 mark on Tuesday. The surge in prices to all-time highs comes ahead of the launch ofEthereum futurestrading, kicking-off from February 8.
ETH/USD: Holding onto the recovery gains

ETH/USD: Daily chart
The daily chartof Ethereum shows that the price is in a gradual uptrend, wavering in a rising channel formation.
The technical setup appears constructive as long as the bulls hold above the 21-daily moving average (DMA) at $1205.
The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hold higher above the midline, allowing more gains. The RSI is seen at 59.50, as of writing. Also, the No, 2 coin holds above all the major averages on the said timeframe, keeping the buyers hopeful.
Acceptance above the intermittent highs near $1275 is critical to extending the renewed upside, especially after the price formed a doji candlestick on Saturday.
The bulls could threaten the $1300 psychological magnate, as they likely resume their journey towardslifetime highs.
To the downside, the rising trendline support at $1066 could be tested on a sustained break below the 21-DMA cap.
A daily closing below the pattern support could confirm a downside break, opening floors towards the upward-sloping 50-DMA at $883, as the correction from record highs would pick up pace.

) has provided a boost for the category, with the purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, as well as announcing it will accept the crypto for customer purchases.
Now, as for Ethereum, what makes it unique? And what might we expect in terms of the investment potential? Well, lets take a look:
The Pros
The origins of Ethereum go back to 2015, when Vitalik Buterin and Yoni Assia wanted to create a system to allow for decentralized applications. They wanted to go beyond the monetary use-case of Bitcoin and make a coding system.
Financial backers were needed to commercialize Ethereum. So Buterin and Assia got the support of Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio.
Over the years, there has been significant innovation in regards to Ethereum. Here are just some of the cryptocurrencys advantages:
Anyone can use Ethereum for banking services, such as for savings, borrowings, and lending.
There is a high level of privacy since you do not have to provide many personal details when using an Ethereum app.
You do not have to go through an intermediary to make a transaction.
Compatibility is built into the platform. This has allowed for a rich ecosystem of applications.
Transaction fees are minimal.
However, one of the key reasons for the widespread interest in Ethereum is that it is a viable alternative to Bitcoin. Lets face it, investors do not want to put everything in one basket. Besides, in light of the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, there are plenty of investors looking for the next breakout digital asset.
Something else to consider: Ethereum is in the process of a major upgrade. The focus has been on improving the blockchain network, in terms of efficiencies and scale. This will definitely be another positive for adoption.
But perhaps the biggest driver is the trading of Ethereum futures on the CME, which commenced this week This will create much more liquidity and enhance visibility for the cryptocurrency. For the most part, institutions will have a much easier way of getting exposure.
Yet this is not to imply that there will be a bullish move. The reverse may be true. This is because investors will have the ability to hedge their positions, which could put downward pressure on Ethereum  at least in the short run.
Bottom Line On Ethereum
The markets are certainly frothy right now. Just look at the Reddit investor phenomenon, which has seen explosive volatility in companies like GameStop (NYSE:",2021-02-10,0.9896,0.125,0.009,0.866

"Decentralized prediction market Omen app launches on the xDai network
Gnosis-powered decentralized prediction markets come to xDai Ethereum sidechain for smooth, cost-efficient user experience...
Published by
CryptoNinjas.net
02/10/2021
Decentralized prediction market platform Omen, developed and maintained by the DXdao, and powered by the Gnosis conditional tokens framework, has now launched on the Ethereum sidechain xDai, to enable faster transactions with significantly lower gas fees.
With the deployment of Omen on xDai we increase its usability. On Ethereum mainnet, only markets with +$100k in funding are currently viable now. On xDai this can be reduced between $100 to $1000 due to extremely low transaction costs, which will hopefully open up new use cases for prediction markets on Omen, said Stefan George, CTO of Gnosis.
Most recently, crypto prediction markets were deemed unready for the opportunity presented by the US election, with high gas fees cited as a stumbling block for those based on Ethereum  the move to xDai solves that issue and paves the way for more successful adoption of decentralized prediction markets.
Market creation, trading, and liquidity provision on Omen all stand to benefit from its deployment on xDai, which specializes in fast, inexpensive transactions that avoid the need for hefty Ethereum gas fees.
DXdao is proud to launch Omen on the xDai network. With drastically reduced transaction fees, Omen users can now enjoy near-instant transactions. It is exciting for Omen to expand to multiple networks, illustrating DXdaos commitment and leadership in scaling decentralized applications, said a spokesperson from the Omen Guild, a collective within DXdao.
Omen was launched by the DXdao in July 2020, to enable anyone to create a prediction market and trade on outcomes using an automated market maker, contributing to Uniswap-like liquidity pools.
Omens features are powered by the open source conditional tokens framework, which was developed by Gnosis and enables minting of conditional tokens, an event-based asset class with an if this, then that logic for tokens  this framework provides the building blocks for liquid prediction markets for information discovery and forecasting.
Omens reach and potential through its availability on xDai have already opened new opportunities such as oracle integration with API3 data feedsthat allow users to create prediction markets for prices of the most traded cryptocurrencies and settle them with a single API call.",2021-02-10,0.9851,0.119,0.028,0.853

On the upside, further resistance beyond $150 can be found at $160, $170.9, and $182.87 price levels. With the growing popularity in Binance Smart Chain, it might not take long before seeing BNBset a new all-time high beyond the $150 price level.
Binance Coin Price Prediction: Conclusion
Until the Ethereum network tackles the huge gas fees problem, the Binance chain appears to be the ideal choice to settle transactions due to its low fees and high speed. Although the Binance chain is not as decentralized as many users would prefer, it emerges as the ideal choice when the Ethereum network charges traders transaction fees more than the amount being transacted. Furthermore, being a Binance product makes it even more popular due to the exchanges massive reputation in the industry.

"Cryptocurrency Tech Analysis, Charts: Cardano (ADA) Is Up 5,243.06% Since Covid Crash Lows

- Cardano (ADA) continue to push higher.
- New 3+ year highs.
- From the Covid crash lows, Cardano is up, wait for it, +5,243.06%!
It wasnt to long ago that Cardano (ADA) was oscillating between the 13th to 9th place market cap position. However, that has changed over the last month. Cardanos growth and increase in valuation has been staggering. Last week, Cardano gained a whopping +92.04% and this week its gained more than +30%. In the first 10-days of February, Cardano has gained nearly 150%, moving from a monthly low of 0.3291 to a new 3+ year high of 0.9112. There are a little over three weeks left in February, but if Cardano were to close at its present level (0.8533), it would be the highest close in its history  the prior all-time high close was 0.7203 in December 2017. Cardano is on its fourth straight month of gains. Its easy to forget Cardano was trading at a low of 0.0868 in November and has a nearly +1,000 percent gain from the November lows. From the Covid crash lows, Cardano is up  wait for it - +5,243.06%!
Above: Cardano (ADA) Monthly Chart
But how sustainable is this rise? No one really knows. Personally, Ive been taking profit on the move up. I took some off the table at 0.71 and again at 0.84. I am not a big fundamental person, but Cardano has extremely powerful fundamental data on its side that justifies not only this current rise, but a valuation that would be 10% above Ethereums current market cap is considered to be a fair to conservative valuation. That would put Cardano at around the $6 to &7 value area. Ive gone into some specifics on why Cardano could reach these levels, but in a nutshell Cardano makes Ethereum moot  one more update and well have the most decentralized, efficient and important blockchain in the world.
From a technical analysis perspective, Cardano could very well keep moving higher. The image above shows three zones of three closely packed horizontal lines. Each of the cluster of lines represents a Fibonacci cluster. If we were looking at a standard chart, we would see the distance between each cluster to be equal  but Cardano is an instrument that requires the use of a logarithmic chart, where price moves are proportional. If you were to look at the present trading level of 0.83 on a normal chart and compare it to where the all-time high is at, it looks almost impossible. But on a logarithmic chart, its just a stones throw away. If you look at the Fibonacci cluster just above the current monthly high, youll that the next major resistance level is near the all-time high: the 123.6% Fibonacci extension at 1.30. Next Fibonacci extension is the 141.4% level at 1.96. But we could very well skip the 123.6% and the 141.4% levels to move all the way to the key Fibonacci extension of 161.8% at 3.14. $3.14 is a value area I would definitely take a good chunk of my Cardano out for some profit and wait to add in on retracements.

After changing the account's name to ""Ethereum Foundation,""whoever was behind the attack started posting replies to the likes of Chamath Palihapitiya and Cameron Winklevoss in order to cajole Twitter users into opening a fraudulent website.
Van der Straeten's spokesperson, Jonas Dutordoir, confirmed that the minister had indeed become a victim of hacking. He told The Brussels Timesthat the incident was still being investigated:
The Twitter account of federal minister Tinne Van der Straeten was taken over on Wednesday night. An investigation is ongoing to understand how this could have happened.
The Van der Straeten cabinet is now recommending that itsmembers secure their accounts with the help of two-step verification.

On the prowl for blue checkmarks
Verified Twitter accounts are the prime targets of hackers since their much-coveted blue checkmarks add more legitimacy, making it easier to scam people.

"Ethereum price has hit a new all-time high of $1,837 on February 10.
The digital asset has been trading inside a robust uptrend for the past month.
Whales have continued to accumulate even more Ethereum despite rising prices.
Ethereum price
reached a market capitalization of over $200 billion for the first time ever after hitting a new all-time high price of $1,837 on Wednesday. The smart-contracts giant has suffered a slight correction in the past 24 hours and currently trades at $1,753.
Ethereum price can quickly jump to $2,000
Despite the significant increase in value, Ethereumholders have continued to accumulate even more coins in the past two weeks. The number of large holders with 100,000 to 1,000,000 coins has jumped by six since February 6.
ETH Holders Distribution
Additionally, the number of whales holding at least 1,000,000 coins and at most 10,000,000 also increased by one in the past week. The Eth2 deposit contract now holds 3.018 million ETH coins worth over $5.3 billion. The number of ETH coins locked in DeFi protocols has also hit 7.25 million, a number not seen since November 2020. With this in mind,
next as there are no significant barriers on the way up.
ETH MVRV (30d)
However, the MVRV (30d) is currently around the danger zone over 25%, which often leads to significant corrections. The nearest support level for Ethereum is located at $1,500, which coincides with the 78.6% Fib level of the October-February rally.
ETH/USD daily chart
If that level is broken, the next potential price target for the bears will be $1,263, which is the 61.8% level of the same bull run. The lowest level is located around the psychological point of $1,000.

"Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) are cryptocurrencies, but the SEC
... [+]
regulates them inconsistently, if not spitefully. (Photo by Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images)

Ripple, the U.S. crypto giant, recently filed a formal responseto a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuitbrought by former Chairman Jay Clayton in December.Ripple categorically denies the accusations against the company and its senior executives. The complaint argues that the XRP digital currency was used as a medium of exchange for cross-border transactions in Ripples software products and illicitly evaded SEC registration for seven years.
The response was robust and vehement, confirming the widespread expectation that the company would fight back hard.But there was an even more interesting development: Ripple also filed a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request with SECrequesting documents related to the agencys determination that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are definitively not securities. 
This move appears to be linked to the SECs core arguments in its lawsuit that Ripples currency XRP is a security and that the company and its executives should be punished for distributing it without going through the onerous registration process.Experts and analysts have long pointed out the similarities between XRP and ETH, and this begs the question: why did the SEC declare that ETH is not a security but file a lawsuit saying that XRP is?
Professor J.W. Verret of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University was blunt about the SECs haphazard and inconsistent gyrations on this question in his
Law360 analysis
:
XRP relies on Ripple to make a market in the asset, a role that is common to  many other commodities that are not determined to be securities. And yet the SEC targeted Ripple for failure to register XRP as a security with the SEC. There are a number of similarities between Ethereum and Ripple. A
points to similarities between the two cryptocurrencies with respect to continued involvement of core developers in continued maintenance of the network code that underlies the two currencies.
In a
widely covered speech in 2018
, then-SEC Division of Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed that the digital asset Ethereum should not be considered a security. He observed that if the ""central enterprise"" aspect of a cryptocurrency asset is not present, it may no longer be properly described as a security.
The lines between XRP and Ethereum are much grayer than Hinman's groundbreaking speech would indicate. This is not to argue that the SEC should also sue Ethereum, as that would cause millions in losses to innocent asset owners. It does however demonstrate that the SEC's regulatory approach to cryptocurrency has been haphazard and inconsistent over the last four years.

Ethereum Coin Profile
Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. It launched on July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 114,616,388 coins. Ethereums official website is www.ethereum.org Ethereums official Twitter account is @ethereumprojectand its Facebook page is accessible here The official message board for Ethereum is forum.ethereum.org The Reddit community for Ethereum is /r/ethereumand the currencys Github account can be viewed here
According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

Bitcoin price is in consolidation between $46,000 and $48,000, but bulls eye higher than $50,000.
Ethereum relentless in the battle for highs above $2,000, but bulls must establish higher support first.
Ripple begins the recovery journey to $0.75 after stepping above $0.5.
The ongoing bullish cycle is yet to hit its local top despite Bitcoin brushing shoulders with $48,000(new record high). Ethereumand Cardanoare at the helm of the rally as far as altcoins are concerned.
Binance Coin has gone ballistic with gains surpassing the recent $100 predictionto achieve new all-time highs at $140. Other altcoins performing incredibly well are Uniswap, EOS, Terra, Huobi Tokenand Filecoin.
Bitcoin holds higher support ahead of massive breakout
The king of cryptocurrencieshas settled above $46,000 after trading new highs at $48,000. The recent spike from $38,000 happened after Tesla, the company founded by Elon Musk, announced the purchase of $1.5 billion worth of BTC. Meanwhile, the pioneer cryptocurrency appears to have secured higher support, allowing bulls and investors to gather the strength for another rally beyond $50,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart validates the consolidation by levelling around 70. A return into the overbought region will signal another upswing and perhaps call for more buy orders. Bitcoinneeds to break past $48,000 to kick start the next rally above $50,000.

Ethereum seeks higher support following rejection at $1,840
Ethereum is trading at $1,790 after a minor retreat from highs beyond $1,800. A new all-time high has been formed at $1,840, but the journey to $2,000 appears to have been temporarily halted. Finding higher support will secure the uptrend by confirming to investors that stability exists in the market.
The RSI has reinforced the short-term breakdown on the 4-hour chart. A bearish divergence from the price adds credibility to the correction. This deviation comes into the picture when the price forms higher lows while the RSI creates a series of lower highs.
In the event support at $1,750 fails to hold, the smart contract token will drop to $1,700. The 50 Simple Moving Average on the 4-hour chart is also in line to provide support if the bearish leg extends under $1,700.

Ripples uptrend catches momentum toward $0.65
The cross border token is gradually reclaiming the recently lost support levels. After ricocheting off support at $0.35, its recovery journey has been remarkably consistent The recent break above $0.45 and $0.5 opened the door for gains eyeing $0.65.
However, XRP might retreat to $0.5 before resuming the uptrend due to the overbought conditions, as shown by the RSI. Therefore, bulls must be keen to hold the price above $0.5 and secure the uptrend and thwart losses that could retest $0.45.

"The biggest risk for Ethereum is that it could end up like the Concorde. Thats Lyn Alden, a renowned investment strategist, who wrote a blog post a few weeks back reviewing the Ethereum protocol from an investors perspective. In her post, Alden points out that one of the biggest risks for the value of ether is that Ethereum never reaches mass adoption, just like the Concorde jet of the 1970s. While the Concorde was functional and operational for over 25 years, Alden writes, it never quite reached the product market fit it was seeking for commercial flight. Ethereum has ambitious goals in aiming to become the worlds supercomputer. Developers of Ethereum anticipate the network will eventually host and run millions of active decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from finance to gaming to business and more. Key to this vision is a base layer protocol able to handle influxes of millions of dapp users and their transactions. The base layer of Ethereum, built for its long-term use case and vision, is Ethereum 2.0. So whether youre an Ethereum enthusiast, critic or somewhere in between, its hard to understate the importance of Eth 2.0 to the value of ether (ETH) in the eyes of investors. This week,  well explore ideas for a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain called LUKSO.Then well look at the bullish price activity of ether and how thats impacting network rewards.

Fabian Vogelsteller  founder of digital economy blockchain LUKSO and co-creator of the ERC-20 token standard  is one entrepreneur zeroing in on that notion as he explores using Ethereums passive technology stack for the creative economy. LUKSO is an Ethereum blockchain but not in the way most conceive of that idea. Rather, its a clone of Ethereum that is 100% compatible with user-facing tools such as MetaMask. The project is currently building a new chain based on Catalyst  a clone of the Beacon Chain meshed with a stripped down variant of popular Eth 1.x client Geth that remains in the R&D phase for Eth 2.0 developers  with the end goal of on-boarding the digital economy fringes such as art, clothing and collectibles. By combining an execution environment (Catalyst) with a beacon chain running Casper FFG, LUKSO will likely become the first ETH 2.0 Blockchain to execute smart contracts, even before Ethereum itself, LUKSOs Medium post from Monday reads. Nonfungible tokens (NFT) have been hot lately. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban recently sold a handful of NFTs in his likeness for thousands of dollars while the pseudonymous HashMask creators raked in millions over one weekend. LUKSO has also been gaining traction in that arena. The project was used to verify ownership of digital clothing for the Helsinki Fashion Week, according to an August Vogue article. By securing each item on a blockchain and providing digital certificates of ownership, digital items can be limited in supply, which ultimately increases their value, LUKSO co-founder and managing partner Marjorie Hernandez told Vogue. Unlike other blockchains independent of Ethereum, LUKSO is not a competitor in any meaningful sense to Eth 2.0, Vogelsteller said. Rather, its an independent blockchain for the digital economy that uses Ethereums tech stack in a similar manner to how Ethereum was originally conceived: as a quasi-programming-language for bringing blockchains to life. And while its conceptually simplistic to place blockchains into silos, projects like LUKSO break the mold by showing how Ethereum is more than one blockchain. Indeed, a larger ecosystem of many Ethereum-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum Classic, Quorum or NEAR exist in concert with Ethereum. By focusing on one specific type of user, moreover, Vogelsteller hopes to address one problem Ethereum has yet to answer: How can we make it usable for people? If youre new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about jargon and terminology used throughout this newsletter. Ether price seems to be hitting new all-time highs every day this week. On Monday, news of Teslas $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin and the launch of CME ether futures sent prices to fresh all-time highs at around $1,720. On Tuesday, ether prices rallied again, even as sell-side liquidity dried up, and registered an even bigger high of $1,824. As investors and traders scramble to revalue ether in uncharted price territories, miners and validators on Ethereums dual blockchain network are reaping record-breaking revenue. Ethereum 2.0 validators earned their highest daily total income ever on Feb. 8, at $1.2 million. This only accounted for roughly 2% of what Ethereum miners earned that same day, which was in the ballpark of $52.2 million. The additional ether generated on Eth 2.0 by validators is a small fraction of what miners are making on Ethereum. While the total income of validators is expected to grow as new validators enter the network and Ethereum is eventually merged in Eth 2.0, it is not likely to ever reach the same amounts as those that miners receive. This is because Eth 2.0, by nature of being a proof-of-stake protocol, is projected to issue ether as a form of rewards at a much slower and reduced rate than in a proof-of-work protocol. Eth 2.0 issues rewards in the form of annual interest that accrues to the staked ether of validators, instead of in the form of block rewards to miners. On the topic of network rewards, the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator is ready for activation on Eth 2.0 in roughly seven days time. Im excited to watch first-hand how interest accrues to the 32 ETH CoinDesk has staked on the network and the overall performance of our independent validator setup.

Rather, its an independent blockchain for the digital economy that uses Ethereums tech stack in a similar manner to how Ethereum was originally conceived: as a quasi-programming-language for bringing blockchains to life.
And while its conceptually simplistic to place blockchains into silos, projects like LUKSO break the mold by showing how Ethereum is more than one blockchain. Indeed, a larger ecosystem of many Ethereum-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum Classic, Quorum or NEAR exist in concert with Ethereum.
By focusing on one specific type of user, moreover, Vogelsteller hopes to address one problem Ethereum has yet to answer: How can we make it usable for people?

to get up to speed about jargon and terminology used throughout this newsletter.
Ether price seems to be hitting new all-time highs every day this week.
On Monday
, news of Teslas $1.5 billion investment into bitcoinand the launch of CME ether futures sent prices to fresh all-time highs at around $1,720. On Tuesday,ether prices rallied again, even as sell-side liquidity dried up, and registered an even bigger high of $1,824.
As investors and traders scramble to revalue ether in uncharted price territories, miners and validators on Ethereums dual blockchain network are reaping record-breaking revenue.
Ethereum 2.0 validators earned their highest daily total income ever on Feb. 8, at $1.2 million. This only accounted for roughly 2% of what Ethereum miners earned that same day, which was in the ballpark of $52.2 million.
The additional ether generated on Eth 2.0 by validators is a small fraction of what miners are making on Ethereum. While the total income of validators is expected to grow as new validators enter the network and Ethereum is eventually merged in Eth 2.0, it is not likely to ever reach the same amounts as those that miners receive.
This is because Eth 2.0, by nature of being a proof-of-stakeprotocol, is projected to issue ether as a form of rewards at a much slower and reduced rate than in a proof-of-work protocol. Eth 2.0 issues rewards in the form of annual interest that accrues to the staked ether of validators, instead of in the form of block rewards to miners.
On the topic of network rewards, the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator is ready for activation on Eth 2.0 in roughly seven days time.Im excited to watch first-hand how interest accrues to the 32 ETH CoinDesk has staked on the network and the overall performance of our independent validator setup.
For more information on how CoinDesk went about setting up its infrastructure for this unique staking project, check out our next podcast episode when Will and I speak

Typically, Ethereum-based trading projectssufferfrom liquidity uncertainty due to the ""free flow""of assets to and from exchanges. Wheninitiating a trade, the token holder cannotbe sure of the amount of liquidity for this or that marketmaker. Here's how CoreDEX addresses this issue.
Bringing certainty to crypto derivatives trading
According to its official announcement shared on Medium, the CoreDEX product by Delta Financialimplements the concept of Open Vested Liquidity (OVL). It preventsliquidity instruments from gettingexhausted during impressive volatility spikes.

OVL implements a ""block time schedule""to lock apredetermined amount of liquidity. During the vesting period, liquidity for a given asset looks more or less predictable.
Meanwhile, through integration with other liquidity control instruments, Open Vested Liquidity (OVL) makes possibleall of the conditions for the free inflow of capital within a healthier market environment.
The Open Vested Liquidity (OVL) solution also enables users to unlock ""frozen""assets over a pre-scheduled timeframe.

Also, CoreDEX migrates to a new liquidity providers' token. A newly introduced asset, CORE token, can be locked in the coreDEX Migration Contract and earn owners' fees from both coreDEX alpha and beta iterations.
Another asset, DELTA, will be used to solve theimpermanent losses of traders.
To celebrateits latest milestones, CoreDEX launches an on-chain referral program. Referrals will receive an additional 10 percent bonuswhile the referrer will enjoya five percentbonus in credit and five percentin Ethereum (ETH).

This number of active validators allows Ethereum 2.0 mechanisms to offer a high estimated annual reward of 9.06 percent. In the past week, about365 validators joinedEthereum 2.0 daily.

Are staking rules of Ethereum 2.0 forgiving?
Staking is a key process for ETH2, the proof of stake (PoS) version of the Ethereum (ETH) protocol. In ETH2, it will replace mining as a way to ensure the security and integrity of the network.
Ethereum 2.0's initial phase (Beacon Chain) successfully launched on Dec. 1, 2020, with 21,063 validators onboard. The minimumvalue of the ETH2 stake is set at 32 Ethers, or $57,600 at actual prices.
As covered by U.Today previously, Ethereuminventor Vitalik Buterin repeatedly stressed that the rules of participating in ETH2 staking look ""forgiving""to him. Meanwhile, this has not prevented dozens of staked validators from being slashed on Feb. 4, 2021.",2021-02-10,0.9823,0.142,0.026,0.832

Market Capital: Ethereum vs Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the apple of the Wall Street investors eye right now. The king of cryptocurrency is booming with excellent raises, as high as 2.4 folds since 1st of December 2020. BTCmarket capital rose from $345 billion to the present $865 billion as of right now. Yet, ETHis displaying better results even when it comes to market capitalization. Since December 2020 ETHhas seen an over three folds (3.06) increase in the market capital jumping from $66 billion in December 2020 to the present $202 billion high.
It appears that despite becoming the 6th largest currency in the world and the digital gold in the current cryptocurrency rush, BTCis finally losing the battle to ETHafter almost a decade of competition. ETHis finally taking momentum as the cryptocurrency of choice since the queen is a far better investment option for newbies and daily traders looking to get onto the crypto bandwagon after the recent rush that put cryptocurrencies on the mainstream medias radar.
Ethereum 2.0 for Proof of Stake
ETH
is now moving towards the proof of stakes (PoS) concept where each coin is backed by tangible collateral rather than the computing power attached to the network as in almost all major cryptocurrencies. By 2022, the queen would be taking steps towards the Beacon Chain concept and become the leading PoS cryptocurrency.
Ethereum PoS
roadmap
Bitcoin is volatile and shall the network crashes investments made during the rush can drop as low as 50  80 percent. Bitcoin is anonymous, turns the governments eye towards criminal activities and some third world countries are still forced to ban the king despite the Wall Street investments pouring in now. Nigeria was preparing a blanket banon Bitcoin while Elon Musks Tesla was preparing to pour $1.6 billion into the network. That speaks volumes for itself, while the central bank digital currencies concept is quickly taking precedent over cryptocurrencies.
Since December 2020, it appears that the governments across the globe are silently speeding up to the level while the investors celebrate their new-found Gold. At worst, we can expect a blanket ban on cryptocurrency and even a huge drop in prices shall China decides to cut off the mining power to the network. China is believed to have control of as much as 50 percent of the total Bitcoin mining power. On the other hand, the World Economic Forum is also actively campaigning against high Carbon emitting businesses, leading to another reason for a ban. If such a scenario rises, Ethereums PoS move will prove vital for the cryptocurrency realms existence.

Ethereum (ETH) price surged with Bitcoin to $ 1,800 and set the record. What happened in the Ethereum network when the Ether price broke a record?
Ether price rose 35 percent over a 30-day period. The investment trend that set Bitcoin in motion began to reflect on Ether. Technical analysis made; It shows that big ether addresses are proliferating, it is being used more and more actively and it is beginning to attract the attention of institutional investors.
The expected day for CME Group has come
CME Group, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, opened ether futures transactions as of February 8. According to Arcane Research data, a volume of $ 30 million was achieved on the first trading day. The total value of open positions was announced as $ 20 million.
Grayscale bought an additional 20,000 ether at the end of last week. The Coin Metrics team announced that Grayscales ether fund could grow with the spread of CME Group transactions. Big investors can use this pair to strike a balance in their portfolios. On the one hand, the investor investing in Grayscales ether fund, on the other hand, can take a short position through the CME Group.
Post-record sales pressure began to emerge
The over $ 1,800 price of Ether has mobilized medium-to-long-term investors. At least six according to Glassnode data; The ether coins, which had not been actively used for at most twelve months, began to decline after the price hit a record.
At least three at the same time interval; The number of coins that have not been used for a maximum of five years has dropped to the lowest level in the last four months. The fact that coins that have not been used for years have been in action may indicate that medium-long-term investors are starting to take profit.
Research Results Show ETH Is Cheaper Than Water
A picture resembling Bitcoin whales forms
The number of large investors is growing rapidly. Coinbase announced in its report for 2020 that institutional investors have started to be interested in ether.
Blockchain data show that the number of wallets with at least 10 thousand ether has started to increase, especially after the second half of last year. On the same date, wallets with at least 1,000 bitcoins started to proliferate.
On the one hand, the demand is growing 
The number of active ethereum addresses increased to 617 thousand last week. Calculating this based on the seven-day average, Coin Metrics announced an increase of 8.6 percent compared to the previous week. The proliferation of active ethereum addresses shows that the demand for it is growing. One of the indicators of this is that the number of addresses that contain any amount of coins has increased to 53 million 657 thousand 893 and broke a record.
The average value of transactions on the Ethereum network is up to $ 312. Although the record for this was broken in January 2018, such a high number had not been seen for years. The Ethereum blockchain hosted a total of $ 19 billion worth of transactions on February 4th. This has become an all-time record.
On the one hand, transactions are getting expensive
All of this resulted in higher transaction fees. Based on the seven-day average, ether users pay a total of $ 24 million per day transaction fees. Glassnode announced that ether miners earned $ 3.74 million in just one hour on Friday.

"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is exploding. The amount of capital locked in DeFi, an imperfect yet useful measure of traction, recently hit an all-time high of $35 billion. Today, Ethereum is the dominant network for DeFi in all important metrics, including capital flows, locked capital, number of projects and developers. The exploding growth in DeFi has stoked an already fierce battle among smart contract platforms, aka Ethereum-killers, to win share of the emerging category. Tushar Jain, partner at the crypto venture firm Multicoin Capital, recently made comments on Twitter calling into question Ethereums DeFi dominance: Jains view is held by many smart investors and can be summarized as: eventually higher performance, better designed, less expensive networks will start to eat into Ethereums DeFi market share. Indeed, investors have poured billions into competing smart contract platforms in support of this exact thesis. Yet, despite many competing platforms launching and deploying vast amounts of capital in their efforts, Ethereums network effects and moat are inexplicably as strong as ever. How is this possible? Its possible because Ethereum has powerful intangible assets that are incredibly difficult to reproduce and compete against. This isnt a new dynamic  intangible dominance has long been observed and impacted traditional markets and companies, too. You can generally split assets into two categories: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets are physical in nature  things like money, equipment and servers. For computer networks, a tangible asset might include how much computational power can be delivered or how fast a query can be run  things based on underlying physical properties of the network. Given tangible assets physical nature, they are quite easy to quantify and measure. By contrast, intangible assets do not exist in physical form  such as intellectual property, brand recognition and trust. Intangible assets can be very difficult to quantify, making it harder to spot their influence on final outputs like earnings or number of connections in a network. Intangible assets can also be incredibly difficult to replicate, because their creation often relies on something far more complex, like the thoughts of a human brain. Investors have long known that successful companies have strong intangible qualities giving them the ability to accrue outsized value and stay highly competitive for long periods. Consider a company like Coca-Cola. Imagine you created a cola that tasted even better than Coke (higher performance) and supplied enough capital to build a better world-wide distribution network to rival Coca-Colas (more scalable and less expensive). Would that enable you to convince most existing and new cola drinkers to make the switch off Coke? Probably not. Coca-Colas tangible assets  the raw ingredients that make up Cokes taste, packaging and distribution  are not what secure the companys dominant market position alone. Coke is dominant today because of intangible assets: its universal brand awareness, customer loyalty and the way it makes people feel. Those are incredibly hard to reproduce. Yet, Coke is a consumer brand. What about technology? We find the same trend there, too. Google is a clear example of intangible dominance in a technology market. While Google is widely viewed as having the best technology (part of its brand and thus intangible), like Coke its brand is so strong that it became a generic term (google it). Today, more than 20 years after Google was founded, competing search engines still languish behind Googles 85%+ market share. Why? Unassailable intangible assets, including brand, trust and existing search volume, which together form part of the moat that enables Google to continually maintain superior tangible assets over long periods. What about open-source networks? Do the same rules apply? In open-source networks, there are far fewer intangible assets to work with. There are no patents or intellectual property that make one network better than the other. All networks compete on a vast, completely open plane, viewable and copyable by all. Initially it may seem that this makes tangible assets such as network speed, computational power or capital availability more valuable. But its quite the opposite. Tangible assets are more easily reproduced in open-source software than just about anywhere else. Just as in traditional businesses, intangibles are king in open source. Competing networks are quick to point out tangible weaknesses in Ethereums network: high transaction fees (not cheap), lack of scalability (not fast) and even easily fudgable smart contracts (not secure). But they fail to fully appreciate that Ethereums immense intangible assets are the real moat behind its dominance: Attacking primarily on a tangible basis  better technology and more resources  will not knock Ethereum from its dominant position anymore than better cola or better search results will unseat Coke or Google. The intangible moat at this stage is simply too wide, giving Ethereum free range to continue building compounding tangible infrastructure. Many well-capitalized, super-talented and well-meaning teams have built and launched networks that have struggled (so far) to put a dent in Ethereums DeFi dominance. What most of these attempts have in common is they assume that producing superior tangible outcomes in the same categories Ethereum owns will be the strategy to win. Jains comment importantly makes the distinction of new DeFi users, implying that Ethereums dominance wont last as DeFi grows and there are many new participants. Yet, we dont have to look farther than Bitcoin to see the opposite precedent. Similar to Ethereum, and for twice as long, Bitcoin has confronted and ultimately out-competed every contender to the throne of the dominant, decentralized, store-of-value network. Similar to Ethereum, Bitcoin has constantly been attacked over the perceived limitations of its network, including that its too slow and not scalable. Yet, despite a seemingly infinite number of tangible iterations, every Bitcoin competitor has failed to generate an intangible moat of significance in brand, awareness, trust or adoption. Instead of faltering, Bitcoin has dominated the market with a more than 60% share by market cap. Bitcoins brand of digital gold has become so powerful that not even gold itself can escape Bitcoins intangible gravity. Twelve years and thousands of competitors later, Bitcoin continues to convert an outsized portion of the incremental crypto user.

It obtained them by creating completely new categories  smart contracts and DeFi  that did not compete with Bitcoin directly.

DeFis Curve Finance Is Branching Out to Polkadot
Curve Finances AMM is making its way to another blockchain  Polkadot.
Money market Equilibriumis building a cross-chain implementation of Curve Finance on its Polkadot parachain. Once finished, the automated market maker (AMM) will exist on both Ethereum and Polkadot.
Curve Finance
is one of the largest automated market makers (AMM) on Ethereum. The protocol enables low-slippage swaps of stablecoins such as tether daiand USDC For example, Curve processed $400 million in volume in one day last month, according to CoinGecko
Were excited to see the demand for stablecoin liquidity driving the technology to other chains, Curve Finance CEO Michael Egorov said in a statement. Deep liquidity is vital for adoption of new applications like Equilibrium, as well as for the adoption of new blockchains themselves.
Fees, fees, fees
The cross-chain project comes as transaction fees continue to soar on Ethereum, the preeminent blockchain for DeFi. As CoinDesk reported the average transaction fee broke north of $20 last week.

DeFi projects are now scrambling to address heightened fees, a factor that pushes out small investors from the young market. One such answer is rollups, a throughput solution that bundles transactions off-chain and then settles them on-chain in one lump. Curve Finance has been working on a rollup solution using zero-knowledge proofs and even has a live version
Yet, many DeFi apps are placing bets on many horses  including other blockchains. For example, DeFi lending market Compound announced its new Compound Chaincurrently under development across a few networks.
With Curve Finance running on our Polkadot parachain, we have a powerful tool for exchanging homogenous assets on Polkadot, whether they are DOT-based or not, Equilibrium CEO Alex Melikhov said in a statement. We stand to unlock some true cross-chain functionality.
Correction (Feb. 9, 23:55 UTC): A previous version of this article implied Curve Finance would be building the AMM on Polkadot in conjunction with Equilibrium. However, Equilibrium will be building the product alone.

futures contracts for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum.
The contracts went live under the ticker ETH1, opening at $1669.75, with over 20 contracts traded within the first eight minutes of trading.
By the end of the trading day, it registered 388 contracts, which accounts for 19,400 ETH, or $33 million at press time.
Why It Matters:The contracts are cash-settled and based on the exchanges reference rate that includes data from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, and Kraken.
A single contract has ""a
value
of 50 times the value of the Ether-Dollar Reference Rate Index (ETHUSD_RR) and is quoted in US dollars per one Ether,"" according to the official site.
""As institutional demand for transparent, exchange-listed crypto derivatives continues to increase, we are pleased to launch our new Ether futures contract,"" says Tim McCourt, CME Group Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products.
What Else:Last year, CME overtook several other crypto-exchanges like Binance and Kraken to become the largest market for Bitcoin Futures. Data from analytics platform skew
revealed
that CME accounted for 19.09% or $2.1 billion of the $11 billion overall open interest in Bitcoin in futures markets.
This was considered to be driven by institutional demand for the market-leading cryptocurrency, which propelled it to new all-time highs. Many market proponents expect the CME launch of ETH futures to have a similar effect on the crypto asset's price.
The earliest traditional financial institutions that bought BTC are already looking at ETH, if not bought already. And rightfully so. The most used cryptonetwork + future of finance + a potential deflationary monetary policy narrative make it extremely compelling.
 Qiao Wang (@QwQiao)
""Just like in other capital markets, derivatives have become the avenue of choice for institutions to access cryptocurrencies,"" says Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks.

ETH was trading at $1,730.58, up 12% over the past 24 hours at the time of publishing.

"Ethereum gets bulk of crypto flows in latest week: CoinShares

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment inflows into cryptocurrency funds and products amounted to $245 million last week, with 80% of the money going into ethereum ahead of the listing of its futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, according to the latest data on Monday from asset manager CoinShares.
FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration
Total inflows so far this year into the space hit $2.4 billion, with crypto assets under management hitting a record of about $37.6 billion. In 2020, total flows reached $6.7 billion.
Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and volume, garnered $195.1 million of the total weekly flows. Year-to-date flows for the digital asset reached nearly $260 million.
Ethereums futures started trading on the CME Sunday evening.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, got $41.9 million of the weekly flows, with a year-to-date total of $2.02 billion. The largest and original cryptocurrency had its lowest inflows since all-time highs seen in early January.
James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, said despite lower bitcoin inflows, there was little evidence of taking profits with investors preferring to buy and hold.
On Monday, bitcoin climbed to an all-time peak of $44,899, after Tesla Inc said it had invested around $1.5 billion in the virtual currency and expects to begin accepting payment with it for its cars and other products in the near future.
In tandem with bitcoin, ethereum also hit a record high of $1,779.43.
We see this (Teslas move) as an important moment for market validation but are not surprised by the move, said David Grider, lead digital strategist, at Fundstrat Global Advisors.
We think many companies will look at that stored wealth and that consumer base and start accepting crypto as a greater means of payment.
Grayscale, the worlds largest digital currency manager, posted assets under management of $30.1 billion last week, up from $27.4 billion the previous week. CoinShares, the second-largest crypto fund, managed assets of $3.7 billion in the latest week, also up from $3.4 billion in late January.

"Cardano (ADA) and polkadot (DOT) are now fourth- and fifth-most valued crypto assets, respectively, after they both surpassed XRP in market capitalization earlier Monday. Thats due to the recent rally in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increased cost of using the Ethereum blockchain. According to data from analytics site Messari, cardanos market cap stands at approximately $21.82 billion while and polkadots is at roughly $19.83 billion. For XRP, that figure is about $16.36 billion. The latest rally of the two cryptocurrencies of these public blockchains is not idiosyncratic pumps, according to investors and analysts who spoke to CoinDesk, but is a bet on these public blockchains Ethereum-killer narrative. Investors and traders are increasingly viewing Ethereums blockchain as too expensive and difficult to use while decentralized finance (DeFi), usually built on Ethereum, continues to boom. Data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows when ethers price jumped after the CME launched its ether futures contract on Sunday, the Ethereum blockchains transaction fees started climbing again. On a 24-hour moving average, the networks total transaction fees, as of 14:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) Monday, Feb. 8, was at $1,003,727.15. [Ethereum] is seemingly too clogged, Mable Jiang, a principal at crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital. [Cardano and Polkadot] fit into the larger narrative of seeking for a scalable blockchain, so if the capital within the crypto capital market is looking for some latest narrative to shill, this is it. Jiangs Multicoin Capital, a Austin, Texas-based crypto fund, has invested in many so-called Ethereum Killers, including Solana and Algorand. Read More: High Gas Fees Prevent Ethereum From Being Ethereum Helping to drive the latest ether rally is the explosive DeFi sector; approximately $36.13 billion is locked in DeFi at the moment, per DeFI Pulse data. The majority of top DeFi protocols by market capitalization are based on Ethereum including Aave, Uniswap, Maker, Synthetix and Compound. Using the Ethereum network has become more expensive, and its not just because of DeFi. According to Jiang, another factor is bitcoins latest rally to a new all-time high earlier Monday after U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced its purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin. Right now, theres such a big rally because of Teslas disclosure, and if people are going to close their short position on ether, theyd pay $50-$100 [worth of] gas [fee] per transaction probably, Jiang said. This is no longer affordable [for] any small-size retailers using decentralized derivatives platforms. In the hour leading up to press time, the average gas price was 307 gwei, according to gas fee tracker gasnow.org, which is powered by Ethereum mining pool Sparkpool. Gas refers to the internal pricing unit for running transactions on Ethereum and is denoted in gwei, which is equal to one billionth of an ether.

Given the market focus on all things DeFi, one would be forgiven for missing the recent Cardano upside but the underlying fundamentals are very supportive, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, said. Equally, Polkadot was also highlighted as another actively developed protocol and its interoperability play and venturing into DeFi is well documented. On a year-to-end basis, cryptocurrencies of other major smart contract platforms have also seen significant growth. Solana (SOL), cosmos (ATOM) and algorand (ALGO) were up 320.3%, 141.4%, and 130.81%, respectively, according to Messari.",2021-02-08,0.9832,0.084,0.026,0.89

A total of 1.1 million bitcoin were stolen in the 2013-2017 period. Given the current price for Bitcoin exceeding $40,000, the corresponding monetary equivalent of losses is more than $44 billion highlighting the societal impact of this criminal activity. The question arises how does the uncertainty in the Bitcoin market  measured by its volatility  respond to such cyberattacks.
A recently published research article from Dr. Klaus Grobys (University of Vaasa, Finland) in the well-known journalQuantitative Financeaddresses this question.
In his study, he examined 29 hacking incidents that occurred in the Bitcoin market in the 2013-2017 period. A surprising result of this study is that Bitcoin volatility does not respond to hackings with a subsequent increase in uncertainty between the subsequent day (? + 1) and the fourth day (? + 4) after a cyberattack took place.
However, the study finds evidence for a delayed response in volatility. Specifically, Bitcoin return volatility increases substantially on the fifth day (? + 5) after a hacking incident occurred.
This result remains robust even after controlling for the immediate volatility response at time ? = 0 which is the day where the actual cyberattack took place. The delayed response of Bitcoin return volatility points towards inefficiency in the Bitcoin market as shocks need time to be fully priced-in.
While earlier studies documented co-movements of cryptocurrency returns, a novel finding of the current research is that hackings in the Bitcoin market also affect other cryptocurrency markets.
Specifically, the evidence suggests that there is a contagion effect in volatility associated with hacking incidents. Like evidenced in the Bitcoin market, the volatility in the Ethereum market increases dramatically with a time delay at time ? + 5. A rather surprising result is that there appears to be no evidence for a contemporaneous response in Ethereums volatility. However, the delayed volatility increase for Ethereum returns exhibits virtually the same economic magnitude as for Bitcoin returns.
Another interesting result is that neither Bitcoin returns nor Ethereum returns appear to exhibit asymmetries in their volatility processes even though it is a stylized fact of traditional financial markets that the volatility responds stronger to negative innovations.
My study is a first attempt to reveal potential risk factors and their effects on the new emerging digital financial markets  cyberattacks is only one of these new risk factors. From my point of view, much more research needs to be done on this issue, says Dr. Klaus Grobys.",2021-02-12,-0.9521,0.051,0.094,0.856

Bitcoin is once again breaking the record price, which is already over $48,000, or $177,000. However, this is not the only cryptocurrency that has recently hit a record high - Dogecoin, a crypto created ""for a joke"", also shot up. At the same time, ethereum, polkadot and chainlink, among others, broke records.
The bitcoin exchange rate has been trading at historic peaks recently. The beginning of 2021 has been really successful for bitcoin, plus in recent days Tesla announced the purchase of BTC for $1.5 billion which further boosted the price of the cryptocurrency. Three days later, on Thursday, February 11, MasterCard announced its support for cryptocurrencies, which triggered further increases in bitcoin. BTC's capitalization is now a dizzying $893 billion.
Other cryptocurrencies are also rising in the wake of these moves. Several of them have, like BTC, scored record prices. Here are a few digital currencies from the pool of the largest in the market that broke records in January.
1 - Ethereum
Ether
(ETH) has been the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market for years, next to bitcoin. Its price, according to the CoinMarketCap website, has climbed to a record $1,803. As recently as December 2020, its price was hovering around $500-700. Since then, ethereum has made a massive rally and in 2021 alone, the exchange rate increased by 142 percent. ether's market capitalization is $205 billion.
2 Chainlink

Since then, LINK has become the 9th largest cryptocurrency on the market, with the price rising from $0.19 to now $28. Chainlink's capitalization is $11.3 billion.

It is a so-called utility token that can be used on the Binance platform for payments, among other things. Its price is currently $133, while in December it was around $20-30. The capitalization of Binance Coin is 18 billion dollars.

Polkadot (DOT) is a blockchain protocol designed to support multiple chains on a single network to allow for data or asset transfers, among other things. Simply put, Polkadot is intended to allow mutual operations between different blockchains. The DOT exchange rate is currently $24; in December it was still around $5. The rise to the current price gave Polkadot a capitalization of about $22 billion.
5 Dogecoin

Dogecoin (DOGE) is a bit out of the competition as it is not in the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies on the market, but it cannot be overlooked. For two reasons: first, it shows that even a crypto created by accident and a bit ""for a joke"" as a token using anInternet meme with the famous ""dog"", can give profits. Second - because of Elon Musk, as it was the billionaire who recently contributed to the DOGE record. The Tesla CEO had a whole series of posts on Twitter about Dogecoin, and in them he wrote, among other things, that it is ""the people's cryptocurrency"" and posting a much-talked-about meme with himself and ""dogecoin"" in the lead role. The result: the price of DOGE jumped to $0.07 from $0.008 within a week.

Despite the correction of some coins from the top 10 list, the bullish trend continued on the cryptocurrency market.
Top 10 coins by CoinMarketCap
BTC/USD
Yesterday, the bears pushed the Bitcoin(BTC) price back below the support of $45,200, which limited the pullback from the all-time high. The decline has stopped around $44,000. Trading volumes decreased and the pair consolidated in a short-term consolidation.
BTC/USD chart by TradingView
Attempts to restore the price are still taking place at small volumes, so today it is possible that the decline will continue below the two-hour EMA55. If the moving average is able to stop the pullback, then buyers might get to the mark of $50,000.
Bitcoin is trading at $47,480 at press time.
ETH/USD
Yesterday morning, buyers managed to renew the all-time high to $1,839 before the price pulled back to the support of $1,700.
ETH/USD chart by TradingView
A rather strong bearish momentum was able to pierce the two-hour moving average, but by this morning, the pair has held above this level of average prices. If during the day EMA55 limits the onslaught of sellers, the pair will return to the resistance zone around $1,850.
Ethereum is trading at $1,792 at press time.
XRP/USD
Yesterday morning, buyers broke through the psychological resistance at the level of $0.50 and tested the level of $0.543.
XRP/USD chart by TradingView
The sellers' reaction was a rather strong bearish impulse, which forced a test of the upper border of the sideways corridor of $0.45. This level worked as a support and the price bounced to the area of $0.50, trying to gain a foothold above it in consolidation.
Now trading volumes have decreased and price volatility has decreased. One believes that today the XRP price will consolidate above the $0.50 level.
XRP is trading at $0.5267 at press time.

Price analysis in ETH is as follows:

Ethereum: ETH / USDT

At the 2618 level, selling pressure may come at $ 1776. If decline income, the support levels of 1667 and 1538 should be followed.

An Ethereum-based project has been forced to cease development due to rising gas prices, as the cost of transacting on the blockchain continues to push new highs.
The official Twitter account for social media token project Unite announced on Feb. 10 that the project was no longer in active development, adding that the original idea for the project had been rendered unfeasible by the recent gas price spike. The average cost of using Ethereum increased 35,600% since January 2020:
We are unfortunately no longer actively developing Unite. Gas prices mean the original idea for Unite isn't feasible and after several months of work and many conversations we've decided against building a social token platform on a L2. Thank you for the support!
Ethereum transaction costs hit new highs of $25.10 on Feb. 5, before receding to $16.40 two days later. But the momentum which saw the number of Ether (ETH) transactions more than treble across 2020 (from 418,000 to 1.26 million) continued over the past 48 hours, as average transaction costs exceeded $24 once more, according to data from Bitinfocharts.com.
Unite aimed to allow social media users on sites like Twitter and Discord to distribute Ethereum ERC-20 tokens to their audience and community. The project stated it would neglect to build on a layer 2 solution, referring to projects built on Ethereum sidechains which often utilize radically different transaction mechanics and fee pricing mechanisms.
While some have profited from the rising popularity of Ethereum, the need for a blockchain ecosystem that doesnt collapse under the weight of its own success has not gone unnoticed by developers. Ethereum 2.0, the next major update in Ethereums evolution, will seek to scale the blockchain to many orders of magnitude above its current capacity, while a pending improvement proposal aims to restructure how ETH gas prices are calculated.",2021-02-11,0.9761,0.124,0.043,0.833

Staking is accepted as a passive income method. It allows investors to profit from cryptocurrencies. With this feature, staking can be compared to interest. Staking works similarly as money deposited into a deposit account increases with overnight interest.
The token, which is kept in the crypto money wallet for a certain period of time, rewards the user at the end of maturity. This reward may vary depending on the volatility the staked crypto currency sees during the staking period. In this case, users may have the opportunity to make a good profit, but also lose.
What is staking, what is staking?
Confirming transactions is of great importance in blockchain networks. Confirmation of transactions is carried out in the form of mining or staking. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin use the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, while platforms such as Ethereum 2.0 and DeFi use Proof-of-State (PoS). The PoS system allows users to confirm transactions through staking. New blocks are generated and verified while staking on blockchain networks using PoS. In general, those who stake more cryptocurrency have the chance to become verifiers earlier.
PoS validators are usually chosen based on the amount of coins they stake. Staking is a necessary activity to maintain the security of the network. Stakeholders are encouraged to validate a new block and add new transactions to the network. This increases the scalability and speed of the network. Without staking, many security threatening risks may arise.
Staking: Locking cryptocurrencies into the blockchain network.
Defi staking: Decentralized finance protocols work with staking. Tokens such as Yearn.Finance (YFI), Maker (MKR), Synthetix (SNX) are staked on the network.
Validator: The person who verifies the transactions on the network by staking.
Ethereum 2.0 is among the most well-known staked networks. ETH, which normally uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, is transitioning to the PoS system with the Serenity 2.0 update. Apart from that, it works with many crypto money staking mechanisms such as Cosmos (ATOM), Tezos (XTZ), Algorand (ALGO), Neo (NEO), VeChain (VET), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Synthetix Network (SNX).
In staking, users earn a reward as much as the crypto money they stake. By staking, they verify blocks in the network and have a say in network-related decisions. Awards vary by network.
Staking rewards: Rewards can be calculated in several ways. The network can reward validators as much as the staked coin, depending on the validators active time in the network, or a reward system can be created considering other factors. Examples of the rewards achieved by staking include:
Cardano (ADA): Annual rate of return * 4.28%
Polkadot (DOT): Annual rate of return 13.55%
Avalanche (AVAX): Annual rate of return 10.46%
Algorand (ALGO): Annual rate of return% 7.27%
Ethereum 2.0 (ETH): Annual rate of return 8.94%
Annual rates of return may vary.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of staking?
The advantages and disadvantages of the staking system can be summarized as follows:
Advantages:
It is a passive source of income. Users earn income from both staking rewards and coins.
Staking is not as costly as high electricity consuming mining equipment, it consumes low energy.
It reduces 51 percent * attack.
* 51 percent attack: Individuals or individuals taking control of more than half of the blockchain network.
Disadvantages:
Staked cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to volatility. If the value of the cryptocurrency falls due to volatility during staking in the wallet, the users income will also decrease.
The staked crypto money remains in the wallet for the specified period and cannot be touched.
If the user loses or becomes disabled during staking, they may experience block loss. Therefore, users should be careful not to disconnect from the node.
How is staking done?
General procedure for staking; The selection of cryptocurrencies that can be staked, downloading the wallet application, learning the minimum requirements for PoS (for example, minimum rate 32 ETH for ethereum 2.0), choosing the hardware device to be used (if desired).
To explain with an example; A user who wants to stake ETH 2.0 must have at least 32 ETH. To be a validator, you must first select a node for ethereum 1.0, then select a different node for ETH 2.0. With the software to be installed on the relevant device, the user can start staking. A high system computer or other device is not required for this process. However, the fact that the device is always online is important for the verification process.
Staking can be done in three ways:
Exchanges: Many exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, Kraken, OKEx, Coinbase provide staking within their structure. By selecting the crypto money they want to stake, users can create a wallet on the relevant exchange and start transactions.
On hardware devices: Staking can be done in cold wallets such as Ledger, Trust Wallet, Trezor, CoolWallet S. In this method, also known as cold staking, users keep their crypto coins offline in their hardware wallets while transferring the staking job to an empty wallet that is online 24/7. This method is considered more secure, as the staked cryptocurrencies do not have internet access. For example, those who want to staking with Ledger can transfer the funds in their wallets through Ledger Live and start staking.
Staking platforms: The purpose of these platforms is to enable users to contribute to the economy by including them in the ecosystem of the relevant network. Platforms such as MyCointainer, Stake Capital, Stake.Fish, and Staked provide users with services in this regard.
Staking; It has become a matter of preference for many users with passive income, not requiring high system devices and low energy consumption. However, as with everything, the risks of staking should not be overlooked.

"Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Whats The Difference?
By
Isabella Shoard
February 15, 2021
Whether youve invested in cryptoassets or not, its likely youve come past two of the markets biggest heavyweights; bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).
Making headlines for recently breaking all-time highs, these crypto-giants continue to provide investors with exceptional returns, and endless chatter for the virtual water cooler.
While many seasoned investors know the ins and outs of BTC and ETH, the everyday investor may not be able to pick the two apart on a lineup.
How are bitcoin and ethereum similar?
Bitcoin and ethereumare homogeneous in many ways: each has a digital token traded via online exchanges, and stored in various types of cryptoasset wallets.
Both are decentralised, meaning that they are not issued or regulated by a central bank, financial institution, or other authority.
And both make use of their own distributed ledger technology known as a blockchain.
Whats the difference between bitcoin and ethereum?
Bitcoin is the worlds first and leading cryptoasset, which exists primarily to serve as a borderless, peer-to-peer digital currency used for financial transactions.
When people talk about Bitcoin, they are either talking about the coin itself, or the network as a whole, on which bitcoin transactions are made and recorded.
Ethereum, on the other hand, is an open-source software platform that developers can use to build decentralised applications (dApps), powered by its native cryptocurrency ether (ETH). With decentralised (dApps), developers can build and implement smart contracts.
Smart contracts are computer code that runs according to predetermined instructions and play host to a whole ecosystem of tokens, which are additional cryptoassets hosted on the Ethereum network.

How to Buy Bitcoin in Australia
Ethereums crypto token ether is also vastly different from bitcoin. Instead of being used like a normal currency, ether is bought and sold by businesses, governments, or individuals to allow them to tap into the distributed resources of the Ethereum network to run their own apps.
Ethereum can host a whole range of services, such as decentralised streaming applications, web browsers, video games, shared computing power services, and many Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications.
In 2020, the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit organisation that oversees Ethereums development, announced an upgrade of the platform to a more secure, decentralised, and efficient network, called Ethereum 2.0, which will move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to mine ETH coins.
Proof-of-stake (PoS) allows people to stake a digital asset, such as a coin or token, in order to have the chance to be chosen as a validator of a new block on the underlying blockchain network. The validator collects the transaction fees from the block as a reward.
This makes the network operations more decentralised compared to a proof-of-work blockchain, as the network is not dependent on mining operations or pools.
Some other key differences include:
Age: Bitcoin is six years older than Ethereum.
Speed: Ethereums block time (transactional speed) is seconds, while Bitcoins block time is minutes.
Supply: Bitcoin is capped at a finite supply of 21 million bitcoin. The production of ether is endless.
Market cap: Bitcoin is about ten times larger than ethereum by market capitalisation.
The price gap between bitcoin and ethereum
At the time of writing, one bitcoin costs around $46K USD, while one ether costs around $1,793 USD.
For years, there has been a statistically significant correlation between the performance of bitcoin, and other alt-coins. When bitcoin rises or falls in price, most altcoins tend to do the same.
Why? Bitcoin is the original cryptoasset, ergo its been set as the industry standard. The demand for bitcoinalso makes it more valuable than other altcoins such as litecoin, Cardanos ADA, or XRP.
Bitcoins value can be influenced by the following factors:
limited supply of bitcoin
cost of producing a bitcoin through the mining process
rewards issues to bitcoin miners for verifying transactions to the blockchain
number of competing cryptoassets
regulations governing its sale and custody
its internal governance",2021-02-14,0.9824,0.073,0.022,0.905

"The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is now bigger than that of Google's parent company
Cover image via stock.adobe.com
The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has surpassed that of Googles parent company Alphabet. 
Earlier today, it peaked at $1.53 trillion, whereas Alphabet closed at $1.41 trillion at the end of Fridays trading session. 
Image by
Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high of $49,714 on the Bitstamp exchange on Feb. 14, coming close to the $50,000 milestone.
Googlewhich was founded back in 1998 boasts a 92.47 percent share of global search traffic.
Alphabet is the third most valuable public company in the U.S (behind only Amazon and Apple). The companys market cap crossed $1 trillion last January.
Bitcoin Jumps to New All-Time High, Coming Awfully Close to $50,000
Outpacing Google
As reported by U.Today the total value of the cryptocurrency market cap achieved the same feat this January. It is now up over 1,340 percent since the pandemic-driven market crash in March 2020. 
In 2010, when Google was 12-years-old, its market cap was sitting at just $200 billion. This shows that cryptocurrencies are growing at a much faster pace than the tech giant.
For Bitcoin to surpass $1 trillion, it would have to hit $53,680, which would be a 9.55 percent increase from its current price.

If you are conversant with cryptocurrency then the recent high gas fees that lurk around trading a crypto coin shouldnt be new to you. For any newbie, when sending a cryptocurrency using any blockchain, gas fees are attracted. However, a type of gas fee or transaction fee can be chosen by any user; depending on the wallet used, some crypto wallets give their users the possibility of selecting a type of transaction fee.
Although high gas fees result in faster transactions, many holders of cryptocurrencies have been victimized after putting their crypto assets in the wrong spaces. The option of choosing a transaction fee has caused harm in this respect. For instance, a user wants to send 10 ETH and the gas fee attracted is 0.01
; mistakenly, he places 0.01 ETHin the space for sending, instead of the area that attracts gas fees  sending 0.01 ETHin the process.
Bitcoin and Ethereum high gas fees mistakes
Many crypto traders have voiced their discontent with the current high gas fees. The two most popular cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have placed a lot of users in disorder. Several painful reports have surfaced regarding the spike in
s transaction fees, with the most recent one in December 2020.

Presently, making transactions on the DeFi market space comes with many risks from customers to the asset itself. The Ethereum blockchain is currently attracting high gas fees. However, these reported mistakes are inevitable, and everyone is urged to be careful when making transactions.

About Ethereum
Ethereum (ETH) is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. Its genesis date was July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 114,661,465 coins. The Reddit community for Ethereum is /r/ethereumand the currencys Github account can be viewed here Ethereums official website is www.ethereum.org Ethereums official Twitter account is @ethereumprojectand its Facebook page is accessible here The official message board for Ethereum is forum.ethereum.org
According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

he whole world is watching as Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market keep notching new record highs. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is watching, too. If you own cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, you need to understand how it impacts your tax liability every time you buy it, sell it or mine it.
What Is Cryptocurrency?
A cryptocurrencyis a decentralized, digital store of value and medium of exchange. Its not a currency with any physical tokens, like dollar bills, and it lacks any centralized governmental oversight.
Instead, cryptocurrency relies on encrypted, distributed ledgersso-called blockchain technologyto record and verify all transactions. Think of blockchain ledgers as a constantly updated checkbook that tracks every single transaction ever made in a given cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009. Today there are thousands of others in circulation, including ethereum, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ripple and dogecoin.
How Is Cryptocurrency Taxed?
Crypto taxes are based on a 2014 IRS ruling that determined cryptocurrency should be treated as a capital asset (like stocks or bonds), rather than a currency (like dollars or euros). This decision has major ramifications for people who own crypto, as it opens them up to more complicated taxes.
Capital assets are taxed whenever they are sold at a profit. When you purchase goods or services with cryptocurrency, and the amount of crypto you spend has gained in value over what you paid for it, your spending incurs capital gains taxes
Lets say you bought $20 worth of Bitcoin and held it as it rose in value to $200. If you used the bitcoin to buy $200 worth of groceries, youd owe capital gains taxes on the $180 in profit youd realizedeven though it seems as if you spent the Bitcoin, rather than sold it. For the IRS, its the same thing.
The fact that the IRS decided to tax crypto as a capital asset may have been because of the way most people treat it, says Jeff Hoopes, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina and research director of the UNC Tax Center. I assume [the IRS] decided this because most people hold crypto as an investment, and we tax the appreciation on capital assets held as an investment, he says.
But the IRSs decision may have also been a pragmatic move, says Jon Feldhammer, tax partner at Baker Botts. [Cryptocurrency] started having trading volumes in the tens of millions of dollars each day, and it was clear the IRS was missing out on a significant tax revenue source, he says.
Capital Gains vs. Capital Losses
Heres some good news for crypto taxes: You only owe taxes if you spend or sell it and realize a profit. If you sell or spend your crypto at a loss, you dont owe any taxes on the transaction.
If you bought $10,000 in Bitcoin and sold it for $13,000, for example, your taxable gain would be $3,000. But if you sold the same Bitcoin for $7,000 youd owe nothing in taxesand could even use part of your $3,000 in Bitcoin losses to offset other investment gains.
How Much Do I Owe in Crypto Taxes?
How much you owe in cryptocurrency taxes depends on your annual income and how long youve held your cryptocurrency.
If youve owned your coins for less than one year before spending or selling them, any profits would be short-term capital gains, taxed at your normal income tax rate.
If youve held your crypto for one year or more, any profit would be long-term capital gains, taxed at a lower rate, determined by your annual income.
If you earn cryptocurrency by mining it, or receive it as a promotion or as payment for goods or services, it counts as regular taxable income. You owe tax on the entire value of the crypto on the day you received it, at your regular income tax rate.
In addition, if you hold cryptocurrency from these activities, and either spend or sell them later for more than their value when you first received them, you owe short- or long-term capital gains taxes on the profits, based on how long youve held it.
Do I Owe Taxes on Cryptocurrency?
Whether you owe taxes on your cryptocurrency depends on how you got it and how you use it.
Did you mine cryptocurrency? Mining crypto is when you use computers to solve complicated equations and record data on the blockchain. In exchange for this work, you may receive payment in new crypto tokens. You owe taxes on the entire value of cryptocurrency youve obtained by mining.
Did you get crypto as a reward or an airdrop? If you receive cryptocurrency through a marketing promotion or an airdrop, it counts as taxable income.
Did you receive payment for goods or services in cryptocurrency? If someone pays you crypto for goods or services rendered, the entire payment counts as taxable income, just as if they paid you in cash. Unlike a cash payment, though, your customer might also owe income taxes if their crypto provides them with greater value than they paid for it.
Did you sell cryptocurrency to realize an investment gain? If you sell crypto for more than you paid for it, you owe tax on the gain as you would with stocksor mutual funds
Did you convert or exchange one crypto for another? When you convert or exchange cryptoswapping bitcoin for ethereum, for exampleyou owe taxes on any gains you earn in the transaction. If you purchased $400 worth of bitcoin and used it to buy $1,000 worth of ethereum, youd owe taxes on $600 in realized profit, even though youre just exchanging one crypto for another.
While this might seem like a lot to track, dont take any shortcuts. Taxpayers are required to report their crypto transactions on their tax returns, says Feldhammer. The IRS is cracking down on this.

ConsenSys, part of the Ethereum ecosystem, is providing scholarships to Iranian women to enable Ethereum-based coding. Scholarship women can participate in a special education program for the Solidity language.
ConsenSys moved its course to train new Ethereum developers to Iran. Founded by Ethereum founder Joseph Lubin, the company began offering scholarships to Iranian women.
They are learning to use solidity
ConsenSys Academy offers a course called Developer Program Bootcamp for those who want to become blockchain experts. Participants take classes for at least ten weeks to learn Solidity, Ethereums own programming language. The cost of the course is $ 985.
Scholarships started to be given to Iranian women to learn how to code Ethereum. According to CoinDesks report, seven women successfully completed the course. The foundation of the project was laid in cooperation with ConsenSys, Women in Blockchain and CoinIran.
New job opportunities arise
Women who complete the course can use smart contract technology and develop new applications. This expertise gained in the blockchain space gives them new business opportunities. One of the names who took this opportunity was Sahar Rahbari, 38.
Rahbari, a mother of two, worked and sold agricultural produce in Yasoui. Rahbari successfully completed the ConsenSys course in 2020 and started working freelance on blockchain projects in Iran. Expressing that there are not many job opportunities in Iran, Rahbari said the following about his overseas projects:
We can receive payments in cryptocurrency for jobs coming from abroad. Thats the best part of this job. We are in a bad political situation in Iran. I cannot transfer money abroad. But with crypto money, small amounts of transactions can be made. This is one of the reasons I chose this field. 
Women in Iran constitute 70 percent of the graduates of science, technology, engineering and mathematics at universities. Local organizations that encourage some of these women to become blockchain experts want to train more people on smart contracting over time.

"February 21, 2021
14.7% of ETHs Circulating Supply has Been Dormant for 2  3 Yrs
This amount of Ethereum that has laid dormant for two to three years is roughly 14.7% of the total circulating supply of 114.759 million ETH. Furthermore, the dormant Ethereum is valued at $32.553 Billion using ETHs current value of $1,928.
Such an amount of Ethereum not having moved for such a long time is proof that ETH investorsare particularly bullish about the long-term future of the digital asset and the corresponding network.
Ethereums $1,800 is the Level to Watch During ETHs Weekly Close
Concerning price action, Ethereum has just set a new all-time high of $2,042  Binance rate. This new milestone was achieved yesterday, February 20th, as Bitcoin also set a new all-time high of $57,717. However, both digital assets have since experienced a pullback that has resulted in ETH momentarily dropping to the $1,800 support zone before bouncing back to its current price of $1,928.
To note is that the weekly close is only a few hours away and Ethereums $1,800 will be an area of importance for ETH to maintain its bullishness throughout the rest of the month.
However, fundamentally, Ethereum has several bullish reasons to keep thriving as shall be outlined below.
Grayscale is continually accumulating Ethereumwith 223,161 ETH ($430 million) purchased in the last 30 days
Ethereum has continued to gain popularity as demonstrated by Gene Simmons announcing he had purchased $300k worthback in October 2020
Volume and open interest of the CME Ethereum futures have continued to growsince their launch earlier this month
ETH 2.0 staking is ongoing with 3.174 million Ethereum ($6.168 Billion) locked in the deposit contract

Ethereum (ETHUSD)
Above: Ethereum (ETH/USD) Weekly Chart with Fibonacci Extensions
The image above displays Ethereum weekly candlestick chart. Its important to identify levels where we may find stiff resistance and important highs for any financial instrument. One of the easiest and best ways to do this is through the use of Fibonacci Extensions. Ive drawn three here on Ethereums chart. The first, colored in green, is the extension from the Dec 26 2016 low to the January 15 2018 high and then to the first retracement low in November 2018. The important extension for this swing is the 61.8% at 2156.05. The next major extension, colored in red, begins at the Nov 18 swing low to the June 2019 high and then to the confirmation swing low of the Covid Crash in 2020. The important Fibonacci extension number for the second swing is the 200% level at 2055.26. The third and final extension level, color in light blue, is from the Covid Crash low to the June 2020 high and the June 2020 low. That final Fibonacci extension level is the 241.4% level at 2009.78. We can see a great lcustoer of Fibonacci extension levels all converging between the 2000 and 2200 value areas. Look for the new swing high to be around this level.
Litecoin (LTCUSD)
Above: Litecoin (LTC/USD) Weekly Chart with Fibonacci Extensions
Litecoin still has not reached its prior all-time high, so it may be an interesting to watch as the broader market either continues to rally or retraces. Litecoin certainly does have a history of operating in a non-correlative manner from time to time against Bitcoin and the broader market. There are two Fibonacci Extension levels that I think are important to watch for, which utilize nearly the same date structures as Ethereums. The first Fibonacci extension cluster is where we find 61.8% extension of swing one at 388.73 (green), the 141.4% extension of swing two (red) at 419.20, and the 261.8% extension of swing three (blue) at 396.65. The value area of this cluster is very near the all-time high and encompasses a price range between 380 and 445. The second Fibonacci extension cluster would mean new all-time highs were created. The first extension level is the 88.6% at 1346.05 followed by the second swing extension of 200% at 1265.05 and finally the third extension of 400% at 1303.64%. The price ranges between 1250 and 1350 create this second extension level.
Cardano (ADAUSD)
Above: Cardano (ADA/USD) Weekly Chart with Fibonacci Extensions
Similar to Litecoin, Cardano has two key Fibonacci Extensions clusters. Swings one, two and three are color coded the same as the prior two cryptocurrencies weve reviewed. The first cluster zone encompasses the Fibonacci extension 127.2% at 1.5142 of swing one, 300% at 1.5991 at swing two, and 141.4% of 1.4722 of swing three. The second extension zone is a fairly conservative one compared to Litecoins second cluster. For Cardanos second Fibonacci extension cluster, we can see it encompasses the 141.4% extension of swing one at 2.376, the 327.2% extension of swing two at 2.3682, and the 1.618% extension of swing three at 2.2600.

"Charles Schwab
(SCHW), for instance, allows customers to trade Toronto-listed securities, but not non-U.S.-exchange-traded products such as Canadian ETFs.
There is no U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, but there are an increasing number of securities structured as trusts that trade on public markets. The largest of those is the
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust
(GBTC), which now has nearly $40 billion in assets. Another one that recently launched is called the Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC). Those trusts, unlike ETFs, can trade at a large premium to their net asset values, so they have added risk.
One question now is whether Bitcoin will maintain its momentum or whether other digital assets could steal its thunder. While Bitcoin is unique in that its supply is capped, and it has gotten support from regulators, other coins may end up being more useful.
One prominent investor in the space thinks Bitcoin will keep rising, but also expects that some other digital assets will rise even more.

Its our view that Bitcoin is going to go up a lot over the next few years, he said in a recent interview. But Ethereum and Polka Dot are going to go up even more. And then the tokens built on top of those protocols will go up even more than that.

One question now is whether Bitcoin will maintain its momentum or whether other digital assets could steal its thunder. While Bitcoin is unique in that its supply is capped, and it has gotten support from regulators, other coins may end up being more useful.

"Passing the $1 trillion mark, Bitcoin is almost as big as Google
By
Chuong Nguyen
February 19, 2021 10:06AM PST
The price of Bitcoinhas surged in recent days, sending the cryptocurrencyvalue soaring. With a high value of $53,750 per coin as traded on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, the combined value of all existing coins is now $1 trillion dollars.
This means that Bitcoins market capitalization rivals some of the top and most well-known technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is valued at $1.42 trillion, for comparison, putting Bitcoin within striking distance of it if the cryptocurrencys price continues to rise, while Amazons current market capitalization is $1.67 trillion and Microsofts value sits at $1.82 trillion.
At $1 trillion, Bitcoins market value when counting all the coins in circulation, is double what the currencys value was at the start of 2021. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin was at $500 million. So in a little more than two months time, Bitcoins combined earn market value is nearly the same as Citibanks highly publicizedand embarrassing $500 million blunder.
However, for Bitcoin to catch up to Apple, which is the worlds most valuable company, it would have to once again double todays valuations. Apples market capitalization stands at $2.18 trillion.
The rise in Bitcoins value is also spilling into other adjacent cryptocurrencies, as Ethereum mining is also picking up steam. To the disdain of gamers, miners of the Ethereum currencyhave been snapping up hard-to-find graphics cards to build their mining rigs The situation got so bad that Nvidia was forced to create software locks on its most recent GPUs to deter miners and try to reserve the limited inventory of graphics cards for the companys gaming customers. Separately, Nvidia also created a dedicated crypto-mining processorspecific for Ethereum mining.
The cryptocurrency market has experienced a renewed interest in recent months. Notably, Tesla had made a $1.5 billion bet on Bitcoin, with CEO Elon Musk saying that cryptocurrency is slightly better than holding cash.
Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&P500 company, Musk wrote in a tweet, noting that Teslas recent moves in the cryptocurrency market are not directly reflective of my opinion.
Tesla also announced that it will also accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its electric vehicles.
That said, Musk doesnt seem as enthusiastic about Bitcoin as the company he helms.
To be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer, the CEO said in a subsequent tweet. I dont even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldnt look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is almost.'
Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, however, takes a more neutral view on Bitcoin, according to his statement in a recent CNBCinterview. Gates admitted that he, however, doesnt own Bitcoin, opting instead to focus his energy on his philanthropic endeavors.
Analysts still appear divided on their view of Bitcoin. Some claim that breaking the $1 trillion asset cap could lead the currency to climb higher  even as high as $200 trillion or $400 trillion, according to Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Kippsten in a reportby Forbes Others, like analysts from JP Morgan, view the meteoric rise as unsustainable.
Aside from corporations and institutional investors, there have been a lot of new individuals who are finding interest in cryptocurrency, with crytpcurrency exchange company Binance citing more than 300,000 new user registrations daily and volumes that are even higher than at the currencys former peak in 2017, according to a Business Insiderreport.

market capitalization is making a gigantic leap toward $1 trillion. At the moment, BTC has a market valuation of $982 billion and is significantly above Ethereums $221 billion.
Intriguingly, Binance Coin (BNB) has moved into the top three after rallying 42% in the last 24 hours. BNB is now the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $40 billion. The Binance exchange native token is currently trading at $262.
Bitcoin spikes to another new all-time high
Bitcoin bulls are not relenting in the fight gains toward $55,000 (near-term goal). They started by defending support above $50,000 and later ensured that BTC settled above $51,000. The pioneer cryptocurrency spent some time at the ascending channels middle boundary, but bulls seem to have increased their positions, sending to a new all-time high of $52,993 on Coinbase
The bullish outlookis set to remain in place in the coming sessions based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). As the MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line, the bullish impulse gets stronger. A break above $53,000 is likely to trigger the fear of missingout (FOMO), which could leave open air toward $55,000.
BTC/USD 4-hour chart
A correction will appear if Bitcoin fails to close the day above $52,000. An increase in overhead pressure will also jeopardize the support at the channels middle boundary. While $51,000 has functioned as an anchor before, BTC could retest $50,000, a rather make or break price level.
Ethereum closes in on $2,000
Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has settled above a vital price level. The break above $1,900 brought it close to $2,000. However, closing the day above the same level is viewed as a bullish signal. For now,
all eyes are glued on $2,000
, which may trigger FOMO as investors speculate the potential rise to $3,000.
The MACD confirms that bulls are in control, hence rising past $2,000 during the weekend session. If the uptrend stalls, a consolidation period above $1,900 will allow bulls to focus on higher levels as they plan their next attack mission.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
Note that any bearish signals may trigger massive losses under $1,900, as investors could panic sell to take profit. Near-term support is the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1,820. Other vital levels to keep in mind are $1,800, the 100 SMA currently at $1,750, and the recent support at $1,660.
Ripple renews the uptrend on breaking critical level
Ripple established support at the 100 SMA on the 4-hour chart, setting the cryptocurrency on a recovery path. Gaining ground above $0.55 seems to have triggered more buying orders increasing the tailwind behind the cross-border token.
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.57 after breaking past the 50 SMA. On the upside, some resistance is expected at $0.6 but bulls eye $0.65 to be
a stepping stone for gains back to $0.75
(yearly highs).
The MACD highlights a bullish impulse and cross above the midline to validate the uptrend. On the other hand, support above the 50 SMA must be defended to ensure that the uptrend remains intact.
XRP/USD 4-hour chart
A correction may come into the picture if XRP slices through the 50 SMA on the flip side. The support at $0.5 must remain unshaken; otherwise, losses may be triggered towards the 100 SMA at $0.5.

Bitcoin
Even though people use various online payment options, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming more prevalent every day. While its true that many internet users dont understand blockchain technology, that doesnt prevent them from purchasing different items and paying for services paying with Bitcoin, Tether, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.
Nowadays, we can use cryptocurrencies for all sorts of things. Thats why
, people average 1,200,000 transactions per day using Ethereum and 300,000 with Bitcoin.
Why do people use cryptocurrencies?
The main reason people use Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency are that they are secure. Therefore, you can make your purchases online without worrying whether your personal information will be leaked.
Another thing that makes cryptocurrencies appealing is the fact they are decentralized. In other words, there isnt an authority that regulates these currencies. This has its advantages and disadvantages, but, judging by the popularity of most cryptocurrencies, it has an overall positive effect.
Which are the countries where cryptocurrencies are prevalent?
Generally speaking, you can find multiple cryptocurrency users in almost every country in the world. Yet, some places, such as Russia and Ukraine, have way more cryptocurrency users than others.
In addition to these two, countries like Venezuela and Nigeria are also among the worlds biggest cryptocurrency fans. Bitcoin and Ethereum allow them to send money across borders and pay for various items and services.
Is Bitcoin better than every other cryptocurrency?
Most people who are not into cryptocurrencies have heard of Bitcoin because it often gets featured in the news. One of the things that make it more attractive than everything else is the price. After the boom in 2017, experts predicted that the cryptocurrency bubble will eventually burst and put an end to Bitcoin and its alternatives. Although the following year was challenging, late 2020 and early 2021 made Bitcoin even more popular. At one point, this digital currency reached nearly $42,000, a record for any cryptocurrency.
With more than 18.6 million Bitcoins globally, it doesnt look like this cryptocurrency will go away anytime soon. However, another digital currency is also making a name for itself, and thats Ethereum. The fact that it is cheaper means that more people have access to it, so it will be interesting to see whether it can surpass Bitcoin.
A few things to keep in mind
There are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there, and each one has the potential to become the next Bitcoin. However, before you start using or investing in any of them, you have to remember that most of them are highly volatile. As a result, its nearly impossible to predict what would happen with their price in the future.
You should also be aware that some online shops do not accept any cryptocurrencies yet. Those that do might require you to pay an additional fee whenever youre making a transaction with Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.",2021-02-19,0.9882,0.088,0.023,0.889

NVIDIA brings new custom GPUs for cryptocurrency miners; RTX 3060 gets hash rate limited
Another day and another news coming from the house of NVIDIA. With the growing demands of GPUs, most of which are being gobbled up by cryptocurrency miners, the GPU maker has now announced a new product line that will only cater to mining Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. The company is also restricting the capability of the upcoming RTX 3060by reducing the hash rate, or the mining efficiency by about 50%.
With the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on Feb. 25, were taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers,
said NVIDIA in a post
. Essentially, the company has designed the software drivers for the RTX 3060 in such a way that it can detect if the card is being used for mining, thereby limiting the overall capability. This seems like a necessary step as gamers around the world are dealing with either limited stocks or extremely high prices quoted by retailers and scalpers online.
Hi Ryan. Its not just a driver thing. There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.
 Bryan Del Rizzo (@bdelrizzo)
February 19, 2021
CMP or Cryptocurrency Mining Processor is the newest product that NVIDIA will offer to specifically address the needs of Ethereum mining. CMPs will be sold via authorized partners including Asus, Colorful, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, Palit, and more. These will be optimized to deliver the best mining performance with a completely different set of specifications. For instance, the CMP cards would not include display outputs, allowing them to be more densely packed and have a lower peak core voltage and frequency. Thus manufacturing these would not impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers, though crypto miners might just gobble down stocks of both.
There are a variety of models in the series including the NVIDIA CMP 30HX processor which would come with 26MHps Ethereum hash rate, 125W rated power, an 8-pin power connector, and 6GB of RAM. The NVIDIA CMP 40HX processor will offer 36MHps Ethereum hash rate, 185W rated power, an 8-pin power connector, and 8GB of RAM. The NVIDIA CMP 50HX processor will come with 45MHps Ethereum hash rate, 250W rated power, 28-pin power connectors, and 10GB of RAM. And lastly, the NVIDIA CMP 90HX processor will come with 86MHps Ethereum hash rate, 320W rated power, 28-pin power connectors, and 10GB of RAM. The CMP 30HX and CMP 40HX will be available in the first quarter of 2021 while the CMP 50HX and NVIDIA CMP 90HX will be available sometime in the second quarter of this year.
NVIDIA is primarily taking this step as an attempt to salvage the GeForce RTX 3060 which is going to hit stores on 25th February. The company has been facing monumental demands for its current line of RTX 30-series cards including the RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and the RTX 3090 Weve heard reports of scalpers deploying bots to automatically buy GPUs in bulk to sell them off at extremely high prices on eBay.
While the company suggests that the drivers of the RTX 3060 would downgrade the mining capability of the GPU, Bryan Del Rizzo, Global Director, Public Relations at NVIDIA has given some more information. According to Mr. Rizz, there will be a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 chip, and the BIOS (firmware) that would prevent the ability to remove the hash rate limiter. This means that it wont be possible to use an older version of the driver to restore the originally intended hash rate. We are yet to get a confirmation from NVIDIA whether it would bring a similar update for the existing line of RTX cards to bring a balance in the supply and demand of GPUs around the world.
A few days ago, NVIDIA had announced its plans of
releasing stock of its older GPUs
 the GTX 1050 Ti and the mid-range RTX 2060 as another measure to control the growing demands of the GPU market. Certain retailers in Europe were recently spottedlisting the upcoming GeForce RTX 3060 at more than double the original cost of $329.

NVIDIA has announced it will throttle the performance of its upcoming RTX 3060 GPU for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining.
Graphics cards have increasingly found widespread adoption far beyond their intended target. Because of their programmable nature and high performance, GPUs are used in artificial intelligence, gene sequencing, cryptocurrency mining and more. The downside is that gamers are having a hard time getting their hands on the latest, greatest GPUs, especially with cryptocurrencies at all time highs.
To alleviate the situation, NVIDIA is artificially throttling the performance of the RTX 3060  solely for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining. The company says the GPUs performance will reduce to roughly 50% when it detects mining activity. The company has no plans to limit the performance of existing GPUs.
At the same time, NVIDIA is announcingthe release of the NVIDIA CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor).
CMP products  which dont do graphics  are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. They dont meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and, thus, dont impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.
That last statement is of particular note, as any impact to GPU production would negate any benefit of discouraging miners from buying them.",2021-02-19,0.922,0.09,0.04,0.87

Ethereum keeps the record-breaking rally on the table while picking up the bids near $1,940 during the early Fridays trading. The cryptocurrency pairs ability to extend the bounce-off 10-day SMA gains support from the accumulation of crypto whales to favor the bulls inside a bearish chart pattern formation.

Nvidia announced a new line of GPUs solely for mining cryptocurrencies on Thursday  and that it's halving the cryptocurrency mining efficiency of forthcoming GeForce cards in an effort to keep the kit in the hands of gamers when the hardware goes on sale next week.
Specifically, if the driver software for the GeForce RTX 3060 cards detects certain proof-of-workalgorithms used in the mining of digital currencies, it will slash the hash rate. This is intended to deter folks from snapping up the cards to mine Ethereum in particular, it seems, leaving more kit for computer game fans to fight over.
We are gamers, through and through, the Silicon Valley-based corporation insistedin a statement. Yet Nvidia GPUs are programmable. And users are constantly discovering new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.

With the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on February 25, were taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers. RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 per cent.""
The RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethash (Dagger Hashimoto) algorithm which is based on a unique memory access pattern, an Nvidia spokesperson told
The Register
. Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU-mineable coin at the moment and thus is likely the main demand driver for GPUs in mining.
Other algorithms do not contribute significantly to GPU demand and cannot change quickly due to network effects within a given cryptocurrency. The rate limiter applies to anything that uses Dagger Hashimoto or Ethash-like algorithms.
The RTX 3060  which will go on sale at 0900 PT (1700 UTC) for $329 (299) next Thursday  is Nvidias most affordable GPU built to date using its latest Ampere architecture. Its cousins, the RTX 3090 3080 and 3070 cards, were released last year and sold out virtually immediately, leaving gamers fuming. This time round, Nvidia wants to make its hardware less desirable to miners, leaving more silicon for game fans. This also all comes amid a shortage in chips, as fabs have been unable to meet demand for various pandemic-related reasons.
To make up for this crack down on miners using GeForce cards, Nvidia will also peddle a new crypto-focused series of GPUs collectively named CMP HX. These come in four flavors: the 30 HX, 40 HX, 50 HX, and the 60 HX, each one containing more memory and power than the last. Heres a handy table containing each chips main specs:

They lack any ability to connect to displays, making them unsuitable for desktop gaming. On top of this, they have specific cooling systems and operate at lower peak core voltages and frequencies to keep power consumption low for mining.
Nvidia expects the weaker-end CMP GPUs will be available next month, were told, with more powerful gear coming out in the second quarter of the year. They will be sold via authorized vendors, including: ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, Palit, and PC Partner.

Crypto miners will leave NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 to gamers? Pic credit: NVIDIA
NVIDIA has taken a far-reaching decision to protect its core customers. The company has promisedto make the latest Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3060 unattractive for cryptocurrency mining with the GeForce is made for gaming initiative.
NVIDIA will intentionally throttle the performance of the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Card if used for cryptocurrency mining. The decision clearly stems from the horrendous supply shortage of the latest Ampere-based GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. The cryptocurrency mining farms are largely responsible for the situation.
NVIDIA attempting to reign in GeForce RTX 3060 GPU prices even before its official launch and appease gamers:
NVIDIAs GeForce is made for gaming, could ensure crypto miners ignore the upcoming GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Card. The company will ensure the graphics card performs poorly if used to mine cryptocurrencies.
NVIDIA has confirmed that it will deliberately throttle the RTX 3060s Ethereum mining performance by 50 percent. This will make the graphics card much less attractive to cryptocurrency miners. The GPU maker has claimed that their RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, preventing the RTX 3060 from reaching its peak performance levels when mining Ethereum.

What Happened:  Nvidia unveiled the Nvidia cryptocurrency mining processor, or CMP, product line for Ethereummining, the company said in a blog post Ethereumis the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and is currently perched at a record high above $1,900.
The GMP products are meant for professional mining and do not meet the specifications required of a GeForce gaming GPU, Nvidia said. They will be available for sale through authorized partners.

These chips, the companysaid, are optimized for the best mining performance. They lack display outputs, allowing improved airflow and the scope for dense packing. Additionally, they have a lower peak core voltage frequency to improve mining efficiency.
""With CMP, we can help miners build the most efficient data centers while preserving GeForce RTX GPUs for gamers,"" the company said.
As part of the initiative, Nvidia said it has taken measures to downgrade the performance of its GeForce RTX 3060 graphic chips, due for launch Feb. 25, so that it's less viable for mining.

If BNB bulls can keep up this momentum, the digital asset can quickly rise towards $250, which is the 127.2% Fibonacci level. BNB price could even get pushed to $272 at the 141.4$ level.
However, Binance Coin is certainly overextended and bound for a correction eventually. The nearest support level is located at $163, which is the 78.6% Fib level, but it can go as low as $133 at the 61.8% level.

Nvidia
on Thursday announcedit will release a new series of semiconductors specifically for mining ether, the second-largest digital cryptocurrency.
The new chip type is called CMP, or Cryptocurrency Mining Processor. The first cards will go on sale in March, an Nvidia spokesperson said.
Ether mining is a process in which computers solve complicated math programs to help the  Ethereum cryptocurrency network run. In exchange, miners get ether, the digital coin that runs on the Ethereum network. Ether hit a record highon Thursday, up over 160% year-to-date to over $1,914.
Ether's mining algorithms run best on graphics cards, which is the kind of chip that Nvidia is known for. Miners often buy several graphics cards and put them in a single machine to maximize their return.
Last fall, Nvidia released a new series of graphics cards marketed at PC gamers that have been consistently sold out. The semiconductor industry is also facing a shortage across the board
Thursday's announcement suggests that at least some of the demand for Nvidia's chips came from cryptocurrency miners, not just gamers.
""CMP products  which don't do graphics  are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency,"" Matt Wuebbling, head of GeForce marketing at Nvidia wrote in a blog post.
Nvidia said that the latest chip in its gaming graphics cards series, the RTX 3060, would be modified when it's released later this year so it won't mine ether effectively. Cards that have already been sold, like the RTX 3070 or RTX 3080, do not have the same limitations, the Nvidia representative said.
""RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent,"" Nvidia's said in a blog post.
Graphics cards were first developed to enable high-definition computer games but they're increasingly essential for new technologies like artificial intelligence. Their usefulness in mining ether isn't new, either  in 2017, Nvidia saidit made hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter selling chips to cryptocurrency miners.
""Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time it will become quite large,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in 2017.
PC gaming is also growing strongly. Consumer spending on PC gaming hardware was up 62% in 2020, according to an NPD Group estimate. A graphics card is often the most expensive part of a gaming PC.

Nvidia to Restrict the RTX 3060's Ability to Mine Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency miners should check out Nvidia's new dedicated line of GPUs tailored for Ethereum mining (sorry, Bitcoin fans). These Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) cards are set to arrive this quarter.

To help ensure the RTX 3060reaches PC gamers when it launches next week, Nvidia is tweaking the graphics card's software to handicap its ability to mine cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency miners have been buying up the already-limitedsupply of RTX 3000 series graphics cards, making it nearly impossible for the average consumer to get one. Mining surged in recent months, as the value for Bitcoin and Ethereum tripled.
In response, Nvidia will restrict the RTX 3060s mining capability through the cards official software driver. The computer code has now been redesigned to detect specific attributes of the Ethereumcryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50%.
With the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on Feb. 25, were taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers, the company wrote in a Thursday blog post
An Nvidia spokesperson says the handicapping should not affect the RTX 3060's gaming capabilities.
Cryptocurrency Mining Processor
The change promises to free up supplies for the RTX 3060, the most affordable desktop graphics cardin the series. But on the flip side, it does nothing to stop cryptocurrency miners from buying the other GPUs in the RTX 3000 generation. (A single RTX 3080 card, for instance, can generateabout $357 a month in Ethereum.)
Knowing this, Nvidia created a dedicated line of GPUs specifically designed for professional Ethereum mining. The company calls the upcoming products Nvidia CMP which stands for Cryptocurrency Mining Processor.
CMP productswhich dont do graphicsare sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. They dont meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and, thus, dont impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers, Nvidia says.

The CMP graphics cards should also appeal to the cryptocurrency crowd by stripping away the PC gaming-related features while optimizing the hardware for mining. For instance, CMP lacks display outputs, enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed. CMPs also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency, which improves mining power efficiency, Nvidia adds.
The company plans to release the first CMP cards this quarter, with more to follow in Q2.
As for why Nvidia isn't tackling Bitcoin mining, an Nvidia spokesperson says ""Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU-mineable coin at the moment and thus is likely the main demand driver for GPUs in mining. Other algorithms do not contribute significantly to GPU demand and cannot change quickly due to network effects within a given cryptocurrency.""

An Nvidia CMP chip.
The GeForce RTX 3060 Tiand RTX 3070are some of the most efficient graphics cards available for mining, and if the RTX 3060 winds up pumping out Ethereum just as efficiently when Nvidias hashing nerf is disabled, larger professional mining organizations could very well write their own drivers or even BIOSes for the GPU. Nvidias drivers could discourage them from hopping on the RTX 3060 on day one, however, so be sure to slam that refresh button at your retailer of choice on February 25. Update: Nvidia told PC Gamerthat it thinks the software cannot be hacked to remove the limiter. Well see!
Itll also be interesting to see if the Nvidia CMP HX lineup picks up traction. Companies have rolled out mining-focused GPUs without display connectors before, but most miners still prefer traditional gaming hardware for a reason: Resale value. Were in a sky-high cryptocurrency market right now and most modern graphics cards can be profitable, but if past booms are any indication, that can change quickly. When graphics cards slip back into low or no profits, miners like to sell the hardware to recoup some of their investment costs. Remember the flood of used Radeon cards available when cryptocurrency crashed last time? When that inevitable happens again, gamers wont want to buy used port-less CMP mining cards.
And dont forget that the mining crunch is just one of several factors affecting graphics card availability. Long before Ethereum popped, it was already very difficult to get your hands on a GeForce RTX 30-seriesor AMD Radeon RX 6000-seriesgraphics card, thanks to a mixture of insane demand, manufacturing constraints, and shipping and logistics woes caused by the pandemic. Some of those issues may be lessened now, but even months later they all likely remain concerns to some extent. Also note that RTX graphics cards currently on the market arent having their cryptocurrency efficiency nerfed, and if future updates halve their capabilities as well, miners could just revert to older drivers that handle compute tasks at full force.
All that said, this is a welcome move by Nvidia, and one that will hopefully make availability a bit better. Fingers crossed. The $329 GeForce RTX 3060hits the streets on February 25, and as the first next-gen GPU offering with a semi-affordable MSRP, it has a strong chance of landing on our list of the best graphics cards

Bitcoin has been rejected from its new-all time high as buyers rush to defend support above $50,000.
Ethereum breaks out to fresh record highs, with the ultimate goal of rising above $2,000.
Ripple is holding between the 50 SMA resistance and the 100 SMA support as consolidation beckons.
The cryptocurrency market is dotted green and red, with selected altcoins posting incredible gains. Ethereum is eyeing $2,000 after stepping above $1,900 for the first timein history. On the other hand, Binance Coin leads other altcoins by posting massive double-digit gains of over 35%.
Other selected altcoins posting double-digit gains are Avalanche (up 13.2%), Terra (up 13.8%), Huobi Token (up 23%), Elrond (up 18%) and FTX Token (up 13%).
On the other hand, Bitcoin has settled above $50,000but struggles with the uptrend. Meanwhile, the money transfer token, XRP, is holding above $0.5 while
under $0.6.
Bitcoin must hood above $50 to continue with the uptrend
The pioneer cryptocurrency recently stepped above $52,000. The move came after bulls confirmed a breakout above $50,000. However, they lost steam at $52,640 (a new all-time high), giving way to the ongoing retreat.
At the time of writing, Bitcoinwas marginally above $51,000 amid the bulls' battle to secure higher support. If this immediate support is lost, attention will shift to $50,000. Holding firmly to the anchor at this zone is crucial to sustaining the uptrend.
BTC/USD 4-hour chart
On the flip side, massive losses will come into the picture on breaking $50,000. Besides, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows that the technical image could flip bearish at any time, especially if the MACD line crosses below the signal line.
Ethereum gradually ascends toward $2,000
Ethereum seems to be making progress despite the lockstep trading. Over the last few days, Ether has reclaimed the lost ground above $1,700, $1,800and even traded new all-time highs of $1,930 on Coinbase
In the meantime, a minor retreat has come into the picture, forcing ETH to explore the levels under $1,900. However, the MACD indicator shows that the largest altcoinhas bullish impulses and may resume the rally to $2,000. Note that closing the day above $1,900 will allow bulls an opportunity to focus on breaking past the coveted $2,000.
ETH/USD 4-hour chart
On the flip side, bears will increase their grip strength if Ethereum fails to close the day under $1,900. On the downside, immediate support is expected at the 50 Simple Moving Average, around $1,800.
Ripple price is dancing between crucial support and resistance
XRP has been rejected at $0.55 and is trading at $0.52. On the upside, the 50 SMA limits movement, while on the downside, the 100 SMA near $0.5 is providing support.
According to the MACD indicator, XRP struggles to define its trend; therefore, consolidation will precede. Therefore, it essential to hold above the immediate support, which gives the bulls ample time to plan the next attack on the seller congestion zones at $0.55, $0.6and $0.65.
XRP/USD 4-hour chart
The Relative Strength Index on the same 4-hour chart has recently crossed under the midline, adding credence to the bearish picture. If the trend strength indicator continues to drop toward the oversold, XRP will retest support at the 100 SMA and perhaps retreat to $0.45.

According to CryptoCompare, Poa Network is a public sidechain based on the Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will feature the Proof-of-Authority algorithm, which does not depend on the nodes solving mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of authorities, pre-selected validators that will be able to seal the blocks and secure the network. The validators identity will be public enabling any third party to check their identity. The Poa Network will allow organizations to build their own networks with their own validators and developers to deploy DApps. On April 28, 2018, the POA Team announced the launch of a cross-chain bridge that gives users the ability to send POA tokens back and forth between the POA Network and the Ethereum network. POA Bridge went live on May 10. The POA to Ethereum transfer will result in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user will also have the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network.

is a PoA coin that uses the Proof-of-Authority hashing algorithm. It was first traded on July 20th, 2017. POAs total supply is 285,860,947 coins. The Reddit community for POA is /r/POAand the currencys Github account can be viewed here POAs official Twitter account is @poanetwork The official message board for POA is medium.com/poa-network The official website for POA is poa.network
According to CryptoCompare, Poa Network is a public sidechain based on the Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will feature the Proof-of-Authority algorithm, which does not depend on the nodes solving mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of authorities, pre-selected validators that will be able to seal the blocks and secure the network. The validators identity will be public enabling any third party to check their identity. The Poa Network will allow organizations to build their own networks with their own validators and developers to deploy DApps. On April 28, 2018, the POA Team announced the launch of a cross-chain bridge that gives users the ability to send POA tokens back and forth between the POA Network and the Ethereum network. POA Bridge went live on May 10. The POA to Ethereum transfer will result in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user will also have the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network.

According to CryptoCompare, Poa Network is a public sidechain based on the Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will feature the Proof-of-Authority algorithm, which does not depend on the nodes solving mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of authorities, pre-selected validators that will be able to seal the blocks and secure the network. The validators identity will be public enabling any third party to check their identity. The Poa Network will allow organizations to build their own networks with their own validators and developers to deploy DApps. On April 28, 2018, the POA Team announced the launch of a cross-chain bridge that gives users the ability to send POA tokens back and forth between the POA Network and the Ethereum network. POA Bridge went live on May 10. The POA to Ethereum transfer will result in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user will also have the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network.

About Ethereum
Ethereum (ETH)
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. It launched on July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 115,237,542 coins. The official website for Ethereum is www.ethereum.org The official message board for Ethereum is forum.ethereum.org Ethereums official Twitter account is @ethereumprojectand its Facebook page is accessible here The Reddit community for Ethereum is /r/ethereumand the currencys Github account can be viewed here
According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

About Ethereum
Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. Its launch date was July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 115,495,469 coins. Ethereums official website is www.ethereum.org The official message board for Ethereum is forum.ethereum.org The Reddit community for Ethereum is /r/ethereumand the currencys Github account can be viewed here Ethereums official Twitter account is @ethereumprojectand its Facebook page is accessible here
According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

Cryptocurrencies have absolutely captivated the attention of Wall Street and investors since the beginning of 2017. Last year, digital currencies increased in value by 3,300%, ending the year with a combined market cap of $613 billion after beginning with a market cap of less than $18 billion. Even taking into account the recent correction, they've still run circles around traditional equities like stocks and bonds.
Blockchain may offer some major advantages over the current banking system
While there are a plethora of catalysts behind the surge higher in virtual currencies, the emergence of blockchain technologystands above all the rest. Blockchain is the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that's responsible for logging all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank.
Image source: Getty Images.
The entire reason blockchain moved into the spotlight with the debut of bitcoin was the perception that the current banking system isn't efficient. The system presently allows banks to act as the middleman during a transaction, taking a fee in the process. Furthermore, transactions themselves can take between three to five days to settle if they move beyond domestic borders. That's far too long for a technology-driven business world.
Blockchain brings three major advantages to the table. First, as noted, it's a decentralized network, which simply means that there's no central server or hub where transaction data is kept. Instead, data is stored on hard drives and servers all over the world. The reason for doing this is to ensure that no single entity, or cybercriminal, ever gains control over a cryptocurrency or network.
Second, the use of blockchain works around traditional financial institutions, and thus cuts them out of the equation. Without a middleman, transaction fees are expected to decline.
Finally, but most importantly, the proofing of blockchain-based transactions is ongoing 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This allows blockchain transactions the opportunity to settle in a matter of seconds or minutes as opposed to the days it can sometimes take for cross-border transactions.

Ethereum rises to the top of the blockchain pack
But it's not bitcoin's blockchain that's been busy turning heads in recent years. Instead, it's that of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum.
What makes Ethereum so special is its incorporation of smart contract protocols Smart contracts help to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. These protocols allow businesses to customize the Ethereum blockchain to fit their needs, and they're considered to be far more legally binding than traditional paper contracts.
Best of all, smart contract protocols are what allowed blockchain to move beyond the traditional confines of being a currency-only application, as with bitcoin's blockchain, toward being a solution for other industries outside of finance. Don't get me wrong, the Ethereum blockchain works just fine with financial services companies, but that's far from the only industry or sector it's targeting.
In February 2017, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) was formed, allowing enterprises and global organizations to test and evolve Ethereum's blockchain in varying capacity. As of late 2017, the EEA stood 200 members strong, with a number of brand-name companiesfrom a host of industries testing the network in demos and small-scale projects.

Three unique uses for the Ethereum blockchain
While there are countless applications of Ethereum's blockchain, the following three uses are among the most intriguing.
1. Blockchain-based ID
One of the more consumer-friendly applications that's currently being tested is blockchain-based ID. This would come in particularly handy when in airports, and it could wind up making travel considerably more efficient. Rather than handing an airport agent a passport or ID, the traveler, whose travel information and possibly personal information would be protected on an Ethereum-based digital ledger, would be able to access that information to streamline the screening process. This would potentially allow airport personnel and funds to be deployed elsewhere.
Perhaps the broadest application of blockchain ID thus far has come from Zug, Switzerland. Uport, a self-sovereign identity and user-centric data platform, made its platform, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain, available to the citizens of Zug. In effect, there's a real-world application of digital citizenship verification ongoing in Switzerland right now. That's pretty cool.

2. Supply chain management
Perhaps the broadest-based application of the Ethereum blockchain has to do with logistics and supply chain management. As noted, blockchain offers the ability to remove paper from the equation, which is a source of error or fraud. Blockchain data, by comparison, is immutable, meaning it's both transparent and binding (and likely more efficient).
Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain could allow retailers two main advantages. First, the transparency and immutability of blockchain would allow logistics companies and retailers to pinpoint where problems are occurring. Rather than examining copious stacks of paperwork, businesses could efficiently pinpoint deficiencies in their supply chain and correct them quickly.
Additionally, the Ethereum blockchain would allow businesses and consumers the ability to see where goods were at all times, as well as how they performed during quality tests or inspections. It has the potential to be a game changer for the brick-and-mortar retail industry.

3. Internet of Things device management
Lastly, and somewhat building on the previous point, the Ethereum blockchain could do wonders for the Internet of Things (IoT). For those unfamiliar, the IoT describes how wirelessly connected devices can work together to send and receive data.
For example, the Ethereum blockchain could create smart contracts that allow IoT connected devices the ability to order parts, with user authority, to keep themselves running. If an IoT device is broken or has a failing part, it can request the part be ordered or have that command already programmed in via smart contracts. In essence, it's an extension of supply chain management that could trigger machine-to-machine transactions.
Just as intriguing is the idea that the Ethereum blockchain could help determine the trustworthiness of connected devices. With wireless devices regularly entering and leaving a network -- think of newer cars passing through o",2021-04-11,0.9983,0.12,0.029,0.85

"April 9, 2021
An associate from crypto asset fund Decentral Park Capital, Lewis Harland, highlightedthat the all-time high in open interest on CME ETH futures was a sign that institutional demand for the cryptocurrency is growing.
Harland also commented on Ethereums massive supply shortage and what it could potentially mean for the assets price.
Why It Matters:In a chart depicting the total value of all Ethereum staked vs. balance on exchanges, Harland observed that so far, over 1.5 million ETH has been staked in the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain will introduce proof-of-stake to Ethereum as it transitions to ETH 2.0, and staking is a means by which users can keep the network secure in order to activate validator software.
In addition to the staked Ethereum, 2.1 million ETH has been withdrawn from exchanges, and that number has continued to fall.
Finally, Harland observed that as of April 5, 10.7 million ETH amounting to $22.6 billion was locked in DeFi, and the current trend confirms that this number is likely to grow further.
If Ethereums supply continues to drop amidst rising demand from retail and institutional investors, the assets price could have a significant positive impact, according to market proponents
Price Action: Ethereum was trading at $2,067 at the time of writing, up 1.72% in the past 24-hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap hit an all-time high of $2,151 earlier this week, according to data from CoinMarketCap

"Non-fungible tokens
, a relatively new concept, are digital assets represented by data and stored on digital ledgers, or blockchains. Like any other asset, NFTs, via tokens that represent digital certificates of ownership, can be bought and sold. The transactions transfer ownership from one unique entity on the blockchain to another.
Alexander Salnikov is the founderof
Rarible
, a community-owned NFT marketplace for the creation, sale and collection of digital items secured with blockchain.Benzinga chatted withSalnikov about how utility and value can meet with blockchain technology.
Rarible's Beginnings: Salnikov has worked in blockchain and cryptocurrency since 2012. NFTs, which were not at all that popular at the time, caught his interest.
NFT was fun, visualand tangible,"" he said.""It'ssimple and the digital item is yours, in the wallet.
Salnikov began building Rarible, a platform to allow collectors and artists the ability to exchange unique objects over the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)blockchain.
Back when we started, in order to create NFTs, you needed to write code, Salnikov said.
Early NFT adopters included game developers that were deploying codeto the Ethereum blockchainto create their own games, like CryptoKitties
We assembled this simple platform that allows you to create an NFT and sell it. We invested a lot of our teams effort into making it really simple, clean, and digestible  UX and UI were a heavy priority for us.""
Pictured: The Rarible platform.
Rarible's Use Case, Recent Developments: After introducing an incentive program, platform adoption went through the roof, Salnikov said.
We launched a liquidity mining program which basically rewards everybody who is trading on the marketplace, he told Benzinga. We reward transactions so all the buyers and sellers in the marketplace receive a portion of a weekly reward, creating an extra layer of competition.
The program drew in native cryptocurrency usersdue to their interest in farming and governance, which Rarible offers through its RARI token.
Apart from serving as an award, RARI offers owners a voice in Raribles future:token holders can propose and vote for change, as well as moderate the platform.
In September, Rarible launched aninsurance NFT partnership. At the time, the companys platform accounted for more than half of the NFT market.
The trends are working in our favor, Salnikov said. Our plan is to thrive off these developments.
What's Next For Rarible:NFTs have gripped pop culture. Digital artist Beeple recently sold work for $69 million, while platforms like NBA Top Shot are seeing historic moments sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
In light of this NFT mania, Rarible raised$1.75 million in a seed round led by the crypto fund 1kx, with participation by ParaFi Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Bollinger Investment Group, MetaCartel Venturesand CoinFund, among others.
The company will tap into these new funds to accelerate innovation and become the backbonefor more NFT projects by big brands, celebrities and others, Salnikov said.
Were launching Rarible protocol that would allow everybody to build on top of the Rarible marketplace, he said. If you want to build your own marketplace, you can build that on top of the Rarible protocol, too.
With the protocol, platform users will have the opportunity to tap into instant liquidityprovided by millions of monthly users.
Typically, you need to write a lot of code to build your marketplace  we simplify things for you.
Additionally, Rarible is looking to support timed auctions, 3D items, collaborationsand new royalty structures, as well as to ensure NFT metadata is preserved forever.
Over the next six months, our target is to abstract away all the hard blockchain stuff  to enable you to just log in with your email and password, in some custodial wallet that keeps your keys safe, Salnikov said. Were developing a platform where creators, brands, celebrities, and large companies can build a true and deep connection with their audiences.",2021-04-09,0.9978,0.146,0.002,0.852
