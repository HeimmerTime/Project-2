A
s the meme-friendly Dogecoin has showed us, the next hot cryptocurrency can come from almost anywhere. While the majority will undoubtedly be volatile, I don't think we have seen the last of crypto mania, and I am sure there are other growth tokens that will emerge. It will be important to split them into two pots: Those that have real-world utility like Ethereum, and those that are more artificially inflated, like Dogecoin, which may be able to stick around even though it doesn't currently have any unique technical advantage over other tokens.
The one I would like to talk about here is called Theta Token
(CRYPTO: THETA)
, which is used on the decentralized Theta Network that seeks to improve inefficiencies associated with video streaming. Is it worth your investment dollars?
How does Theta blockchain work?
The Theta blockchain is a decentralized infrastructure that seeks to improve video streaming and delivery.
Companies or websites providing video streaming content have traditionally kept it all in one centralized system. While this may be convenient at first, if enough viewers try to access the content all at the same time and put pressure on the system, the stream can become slow and choppy. To remedy this, streaming providers will opt for a content delivery system, in which they disperse a group of servers so viewers don't put as much stress on one single access point, ensuring a smoother stream. But this can be costly.
Theta blockchain is seeking to disrupt this model by essentially setting up a peer-to-peer network that taps into people's computers to utilize their unused bandwidth. Now, when someone attempts to view content that is available on the Theta Network, some of the data powering that content will come from the main server hosting it, while some will come from the Theta Network.

Many in the industry do not view Theta as a competitor to other video streaming sites, but instead as a way to improve the plumbing behind the system, lowering the cost of streaming.
""Theta's innovation is set to disrupt today's online video industry much in the same way that the YouTube platform did to traditional video back in 2005,"" said Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and an advisor to Theta. ""One of our biggest challenges had been the high costs of delivering video to various parts of the world, and this problem is only getting bigger with HD, 4K and higher quality video streams.""
Additionally, Theta has made several big partnerships. For instance, Samsung plans to include the Theta.tv e-sports streaming network in future Galaxy S20 smartphones, and also may bring other Theta-powered content platforms to its own smart television platform. Major companies like Sony and Creative Artists Agency are also backing Theta, as well as several venture capital firms.
There are two types of tokens utilized on the Theta Network.
The first is called TFUEL, which is how Theta pays people for extending their computer's bandwidth into the network. That's right -- when a person uses their computer to share content with someone viewing it on the Theta network, and hence helps improve streaming quality and loading time, they are compensated in full or partial TFUEL, which is currently trading for roughly $0.34 per token.
The second is the Theta Token, which is referred to as the governance token of the network. Theta tokens are more akin to shares, and holders of these will supposedly be responsible for the direction of the project going forward.
Interestingly, Theta Token has arguably had a better run than Dogecoin. The coin, which currently trades at $10.74 per token, had at one point this year climbed more than 17,000% from its price early last year. It recently had a total market value around $10 billion, making it the 20th-largest cryptocurrencyas of May 14.
Is it more like Dogecoin or Ethereum?
You can probably surmise that I view Theta Token to be more like Ethereum than Dogecoin. While it did have the kind of run-up that Dogecoin did I think it was much quieter and less meme-powered. Also, not only does Theta Token have a real-world and unique utility like Ethereum, but it also has a set supply of 1 billion tokens, all of which are in circulation right now, which is good for investors because it can create more demand. While the Theta Token will likely be volatile and there is certainly no guarantee, I see a lot more potential with this one than other tokens that have appreciated greatly.
10 stocks we like better than Theta Token
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocksfor investors to buy right now... and Theta Token wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.",2021-05-16,0.9978,0.124,0.027,0.848

According to CryptoCompare, Poa Network is a public sidechain based on the Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will feature the Proof-of-Authority algorithm, which does not depend on the nodes solving mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of authorities, pre-selected validators that will be able to seal the blocks and secure the network. The validators identity will be public enabling any third party to check their identity. The Poa Network will allow organizations to build their own networks with their own validators and developers to deploy DApps. On April 28, 2018, the POA Team announced the launch of a cross-chain bridge that gives users the ability to send POA tokens back and forth between the POA Network and the Ethereum network. POA Bridge went live on May 10. The POA to Ethereum transfer will result in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user will also have the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network.

Ethereum Coin Profile
Ethereum
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. It launched on July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 115,890,387 coins. Ethereums official message board is forum.ethereum.org Ethereums official Twitter account is @ethereumprojectand its Facebook page is accessible here The Reddit community for Ethereum is /r/ethereumand the currencys Github account can be viewed here Ethereums official website is www.ethereum.org
According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

"Analyst Corner: Godrej Consumers - Upgrade to buy with revised TP of Rs 850
Sandeep Nailwal, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from New Delhi who created the fund three weeks ago, says he has hit upon a solution. He announced last month that his India Covid Crypto Relief Fund has already identified an entity to convert the donations into rupees, and an aid-receiver compliant with Indias Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. He now vows to act responsibly to protect the retail community. The fund intends to liquidate only gradually to protect prices.
Prices of Shiba Inu have recovered about 25% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.com.
(Transparency Update)
We thank @VitalikButerinfor his donation of 50,693,552,078,053 SHIBA to @CryptoRelief_. We plan to do a thoughtful liquidation to ensure we meet our COVID relief goals.
We have decided to convert the donation slowly over a period of time.
(1/x)
May 12, 2021
The massive crypto donation comes at a time when Indias regulator has been expressing concerns about the asset class such as questions about the source of funds. That has spurred discussions about whether charities that receive such donations must dispose of the coins before any looming ban.
Transferring donations, even large ones, is secure and simple through crypto, said Vikram Rangala, chief operating officer of crypto exchange ZebPay, that aims to support Nailwals covid fund. Blockchain has advantages over traditional rupee or other fiatpayments. Theres no way that people are using donations as a way to get rid of their crypto. They can just sell it if they dont want it anymore.
Nailwals team has collected $1.04 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in donation. The efforts come at a time when India is struggling with record daily coronavirus infections and deaths on the back of a crumbling health infrastructure lacking vaccines, medicines, oxygen supply and hospital beds. India has reported more than 300,000 daily infections for 22 consecutive days, highlighting the countrys slide into the worlds worst health crisis.
The Crypto Relief Fund didnt immediately reply to an email seeking comment. Nailwal didnt answer calls and messages. Representatives for Indias finance ministry and central bank didnt immediately reply to emails seeking comment.
1. The Entity to convert funds all set
2. Bank account for this entity powered by @fvbankuFs
3. First Compliant receiver of this fund with FCRA approvals has been finalized
4. Announcement coming tomorrow
5. Cricket legend @BrettLee_58contributed 1BTC to our fund
Onwards!
April 27, 2021
Other cryptocurrency exchanges have also tied up with Nailwals fund to provide support with fund collections, audit, and procurement of materials.
Transferring cryptos from Indian citizens into the covid relief funds is faster as it is easy to conduct a due-diligence on the source of such funds to comply with regulatory rules, said Ramalingam Subramanian, head of marketing at CoinDCX, one of the exchanges offering support.

Bitcoins younger brother is giving it a run for its money.
Ethereum is a digital currency that claims to be the worlds programmable blockchain. Its more nimble than Bitcoin and theres a good chance you wont travel far in the cryptocurrency world before you find out.
But what is he doing? And should you buy it? Keep reading to find out.
What is Ethereum?
Ethereum, the worlds second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is like Bitcoins nimble little brother. It uses less energy and enables faster transactions and more business applications.
Many digital currencies run on the Ethereum platform, which was launched in 2015. A new and improved version called Eth 2 is being rolled out in stages. It will support more transactions per second, consume less power, and improve security.
Ascents Picks for Top Online Stock Brokers
Find the best stock broker for you from these top picks. Whether you are looking for a special sign-up offer, exceptional customer support, $ 0 commissions, intuitive mobile apps or more, you will find a stock broker to meet your trading needs.
See the choices
A big difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that its blockchain ledger has smart contract capabilities. Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that allow you to perform an action when certain conditions are met.
For example, a smart contract in a digital book can define the royalties to be paid when the book is sold. Or it could mean that an insurer automatically pays in specific situations, without the customer needing to file a claim. Payments could also be set up to transfer automatically as goods move through the stages of a supply chain.
Should you buy it?
Like every investment  but especially crypto investments  there are risks involved in buying Ethereum.
On the one hand, its price is volatile. You might see dramatic gains, but you might also see big drops. Additionally, since cryptocurrencies are a new type of investment, its difficult to determine which coins will perform well in the long run.
I put a small amount of money into crypto every month. But before I started, I first built up my emergency fund. I also made sure that my new crypto investment did not come at the expense of my pension contributions.
These moves ensure that I only invest the money that I can reasonably afford to lose. This way, if the price of cryptos collapses tomorrow, I can wait for it to rise again. And if not, I can take the losses.
Where you choose to invest should depend on your own priorities and strategy, but here are the reasons Ethereum might be interesting.

1. A lot of things work on Ethereum
Ethereum is the basis for many exciting applications of blockchain technology. It is designed to be used to create new parts and execute smart contracts. Also, at the moment, you need to own Ethereum if you want to do other things  like trading on certain platforms or buying NFTs. If the crypto world continues to grow, so should Ethereum.
2. Eth 2 will be more environmentally friendly
One concern I have about crypto is the environmental cost. To validate and confirm transactions, a number of cryptocurrencies use a Proof of Work (PoW) model, which uses a lot of energy.
Right now, Bitcoin uses around 130 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy each year, roughly the same amount of energy as countries like Ukraine or Argentina. Ethereum uses about a fifth of that amount, but its still as much as a small country like Ecuador.
Eth 2 will move from the carbon-expensive PoW model to the more energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) model. I wont go into the technical details here, but estimates suggest the new mining model could reduce its power consumption by 99%.
Eth 2 will also be easier to scale and more secure, which is a bonus.
3. I can stake my Ethereum
One way to earn interest on your crypto is to stake.
Staking involves immobilizing your coins for a set amount of time so that they can be used to mine more coins. One of the challenges is that the staking windows are limited. Once they are full you have to wait for another window.
I dont have this problem with Ethereum. Right now, many major cryptocurrency exchanges will allow you to bet until the Eth 2 limits are reached. In doing so, you will also participate in the development of Eth 2.
The wrong side? Your Ethereum will be tied up for an indefinite period, which could last up to two years. Since I plan to hold my Ethereum for the long term, I am comfortable with this, especially since I am earning around 8% interest on my coins bet.
What are the risks?
We have already touched on the general risks of cryptocurrencies. There are also certain risks specific to Ethereum that you should be aware of.
First, Ethereum isnt the only cryptocurrency to offer smart contracts. Currently, several parts are working in this market. They include:
And if these coins can do better, theres a chance they could knock Ethereum down from the top spot.
There is also the ever-present danger of piracy. Not only could the hot exchange or wallet in which you store your currencies be hacked, but the Ethereum network itself could be hacked as well.
That is why it is better to be safe than sorry. As with any investment, dont just take my advice  or anyones advice on social media. Do your research and try to understand what the cryptocurrency you are interested in is actually doing and what its long term potential is.

"Shiba Inu cryptocurrency: All you need to know about the meme coin
Updated : May 15, 2021 05:27:08 IST
Shiba Inu coins gained immense popularity but fell after Buterins donation to India
It being traded currently at value of INR 0.001419
Uniswap and the web version of CoinDCX  have listed Shiba Inu tokens
CNBCTV18.com
share
Shiba Inu, created in August 2020 by Ryoshi, is a joke coin or meme coin which was launched as a rival to Dogecoin.
Shiba Inu has been in the news for two reasons. Recently, Tesla founder Elon Musk had tweeted stating he would like to own a Shiba pup that excited the crypto market and the prices rose by 300 percent.
The prices of Shiba Inu coins fell by around 40 percent after the 27-year-old Russian Canadian Billionaire Vitalik Buterin donated 50 trillion Shiba Inu coinstoIndia Covid Crypto Relief Fund, run by Indian crypto entrepreneur Sandeep Nailwal.
Who owns Shiba Inu?
The owner of Shiba Inu is someone named Ryoshi though no one knows this persons actual name. The meme coin has been named after the Japanese dog breed, Shiba Inu. Incidentally, Shiba Inu had claimed they are the Dogecoin Killer when it was launched in August 2020 and is seen as a rival to Dogecoin. The mascot of Shiba Inu is based on the Shiba pup and looks quite similar to that of Dogecoin. The platform and model are based on Dogecoin too.
How different is Shiba Inu?
Dogecoin has been developed using the same technology as Bitcoin.Shiba Inu tokens are powered by Ethereum. Fungible tokens like Shiba Inu are ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) use the ERC-721 token standard of the Ethereum platform.
SHIB token is our first token and allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them, the official website mentions. More additions are coming up as per the Shiba Inus website. The creators plan to launch BoneDogecoin Killer, the next coin in future.
How can you trade Shiba Inu?
In India, you can trade the Shiba Inu coin at WazirX It was listed by WazirX wrongly at Rs 3 on Thursday and the company clarified that a misconfiguration caused the listing at a higher value. After it was discovered, the prices crashed to 0.0015 levels.
Other platforms such as Uniswap and the web version of CoinDCX have listed Shiba Inu tokens also. Uniswap is a decentralized trade (DEX) on Ethereums network that allows buying and selling cryptocurrencies for ETH and other Ethereum-based tokens. These coins cannot be purchased in Indian rupees (INR) but only in USDT / BUSD.
Currently, in the WazirX platform, Shiba Inu is being traded in the range of 0.001417 to 0.001419.

"Better Buy: Bitcoin vs. Riot Blockchain
Although there is a lot of buzz around nonfungible tokens and meme-based cryptocurrencies, it was the rise in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) that seemed to ignite the frenzy.  With the initial public offering of Coinbase and the prevalence of cryptocurrency miners, it can be hard to determine if one will prove a better investment than the asset itself.  Let's dig into one miner, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT), to better understand what the pros and cons might be.

Crypto Mogul Vitalik Buterins $1B Donation of Petcoins to Charity Backfires
Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo GettyThe worlds youngest crypto billionaire donated approximately $1.5 billion to a COVID relief fund and other charitiespaid out almost entirely in a selection of meme cryptocurrencies named for different dog breeds that then tanked in value.Vitalik Buterin, whose personal fortune first surpassed $1 billion early last week, donated several kinds of cryptocurrencies, three of which are dog-themed and created largely as jokes: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Akita Inu (AKITA), and Dogelon (ELON).The gifts were collectively valued around $1.5 billion at the time they were made. But within hours of the transactions, the meme coins prices plungedin no small part due to the billionaires massive transfers. In a neat illustration of cryptos volatility, Buterins donations effectively depreciated themselves.Meet the Worlds Youngest Crypto BillionaireButerin, 27, is the founder of Ethereum, an open source blockchain whose native token, Ether (ETH), is the second-most valuable cryptocurrency and only legitimate rival of Bitcoin. The founders wealth is mostly vested in his creation, but over the past year, he has also been gifted so-called petcoins as part of a hokey marketing stunt.The canine-related tokens are knockoffs of the meme currency Dogecoin (DOGE), which spiked to record-breaking highs over the past month, thanks in part to repeated promotion from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Dogecoin, which has fallen in price since Musks appearance on Saturday Night Live, is now the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to Crypto Slate.The copycat coins tried to capitalize on the Doge frenzyin SHIBs woofpaper, or whitepaper, the creators dubbed it the Dogecoin killerwith some success. SHIB, which boasted a market cap of $0 on May 7, spiked to nearly $14 billion on May 10, according to Coin Market Cap. In an apparent bid to publicize their coins, the creators of SHIB, AKITA, ELON, as well as some other petcoins like HuskyToken (HUSKY) and Bulldog (BDOG), gifted Buterin large quantities: in each case, 50 percent of the total coin supply. SHIBs creators claimed this had burned the coinsor taken them out of circulation to create scarcity.But Buterin retained control of the funds. Because he held such large quantities of the coins total supply, some thought that attempts to offload them could have a drastic impact on their value. Even before the donation, critics mused that an exchange could prove fatal to the petcoins creators. To be perfectly clear, crypto Twitter account @Waronrugs wrote back in January, Vitalik can rug you. We got a lot of requests to look into it, so we looked into it. Of course, the price volatility is currently extremely high so think twice before going in. This tweet isnt an endorsement or financial advice of any kind. Were only publishing the results of our findings. #WARONRUGS (@WARONRUGS) January 30, 2021 On Wednesday, according to data collected by the blockchain tracker Etherscan, Buterin doled out massive quantities of petcoins to a smattering of nonprofits and foundations, including the India Crypto Covid Relief Fund, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the open source bounties platform Gitcoin, the charity evaluator GiveWell, and the Methuselah Foundation, a lifespan-extension research group focused, according to their website, on making 90 the new 50 by 2030.Within hours, the petcoins prices sank. Dogelon Mars fell by nearly 95 percent, before recovering some of the loss. Buterins largest contribution, 50 trillion SHIB to the India Crypto Covid Relief Fund, had been worth just over $1 billion at the time of the transaction, according to Etherscan estimates. Within an hour, SHIBs price had dropped by 30 percent.In spite of the slump, Shiba Tokens creators released a statement of support for the gesture, insisting that Buterin was not dumping the token. Instead, they wrote on Twitter, he had just brought invaluable legitimacy to the token, illustrating that it was more than a memecoin. The India Crypto Covid Relief Fund added that it plans to execute a thoughtful liquidation, converting the donation in a slow, staggered manner, to ensure that the price does not sink further and eliminate its value.(Transparency Update)We thank @VitalikButerin for his donation of 50,693,552,078,053 SHIBA to @CryptoRelief_ . We plan to do a thoughtful liquidation to ensure we meet our COVID relief goals. We have decided to convert the donation slowly over a period of time.(1/x) India's Crypto Covid Relief Fund  (@CryptoRelief_) May 12, 2021 The India Crypto Covid Relief Fund was the primary beneficiary of Buterins donations. The fund was set up by Sandeep Nailwal, founder of the Ethereum-affiliate Polygon, to help direct donations to COVID-19 relief in India, where case numbers have spiked to heights rivaled only by the United States. Buterin had donated to the fund before; when Nailwal first set it up back in April, the Ethereum founder contributed about $600,000 in Ether and another cryptocurrency called Maker (MKR).According to Etherscan records, Buterin also donated approximately $375 million in AKITA to Gitcoin, an Ethereum-based bounties platform that helps open source developers get paid for their work.At the time of the transactions, the value of Buterins meme coin donations rivaled that of his personal Ether fortune. Early last week, he became the latest entry to the billionaire club, when Ethers price surpassed $3,000, putting his holdings of some 335,000 ETH at a value of approximately $1.3 billion. Buterins donations on Wednesday largely did not come from that sum, but he did move it.Shortly before his petcoin contributions, the founder transferred $1.3 billion in Ether from his public addresswhich he disclosed back in 2018to a new contract separate address created just hours before. The exchange amounted to nearly all of his ETH holdings; by early afternoon, Buterins public address held just $10,000 in Ether. Some crypto strategists suggested to Forbes that the new address provides greater security and privacy, but the motivation for the transfer remains unclear.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

/PRNewswire/ -- The World of Ether decentralized application has been in development for longer than almost all other blockchain gaming ""dApps,"" and finally the team has revealed what they have been working on.
Video of the reveal can be seen here:
In the video, we're shown the team presenting at ConsenSys's Ethereal Summit and given a look into gameplay that for so long has been off limits to the public.
The demo takes place entirely on a live blockchain.
We see battling, breeding, marketplace, and collection - the game's core functionality. The screens are splashed with vivid colors, designs, and animations.
A reveal of this sort has been requested for months, with discussions in community chats becoming contentious.
By showing a blockchain application of this complexity, this update proves that what World of Ether is working on could change cryptocurrencies as a whole and even disrupt conventional video games.
""With so many dApps misappropriating what Ether is useful for, World of Ether shows that there are some outlets with real promise that are original, community driven and aren't hurried together,"" said a user on Reddit.
Currently, there are some of the biggest influencers in blockchain waiting to try this game.
Blockchain games have seen an explosion recently. Since January there has been over
175,000,000 USD
transacted within them, and the user base has grown to over a projected 2 million people.
World of Ether is unique because it uses a combination of cutting edge programming techniques and highly stylized custom designs coupled with Pokmon type game mechanics.
In addition to this, players are able to earn real ETH in the game.
By battling, leveling up, and breeding, players can obtain rare and powerful monsters, which they can sell to one another for the cryptocurrency, ETH, or continue to battle and breed with. The game mechanics extend much deeper than this, as the video demonstrates.
World of Ether is founded by the co-founder of the largest Ethereum meetup group in the world, and his brother, who's a senior developer at GitHub.
Its pre-sale launched on
and sold almost
500,000 USD
of pre-sale assets in its first 48 hours. The pre-sale assets are currently .71 ETH, around
600 USD
, and last month its 2,000th asset was sold.
World of Ether is translated and available in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and French.

"NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) have been difficult to escape on the internet in recent weeks. If you are an artist, musician or any other creative, you might have looked into how to make an NFT. If you did, you probably discovered that it can cost up to $100 or more in gas fees, a required expense for processing and validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Thats just to make the NFT; we arent even talking about selling it. You can't avoid fees when it comes to selling NFTs",2021-05-15,0.6584,0.096,0.027,0.877
"Samsung has made its way to the headlines by being the first major smartphone maker to provide a cryptocurrency wallet for its smartphones. Back in 2019, the company did this with the Galaxy S10, the flagship smartphone back then.

It has included the support for select hardware wallets to be compatible with the Samsung Blockchain Wallet app.Hardware Wallet Support For Samsung Blockchain Wallet AppTypically, cryptocurrencies can be held in two types of wallets - digital wallets and hardware wallets. The digital wallets store virtual assets including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other tokens online. On the other hand, hardware wallets store these assets offline.

founder Elon Musk as several of the top digital coins fell sharply Sunday afternoon following a tweet exchange by the electric car honcho.
Bitcoin slipped to$44,408.51 by Sunday around 5 p.m., ethereum's ETH dropped to$3,379.40 and dogecoin rolled down to around 50 cents.
While the cryptos were lower already, they appeared to slip dramatically after Musk wrote on Twitter ""Indeed,"" in response to a Twitter post by another user asking, ""Bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their #Bitcoinholdings. With the amount of hate

The ambiguous response appeared to spur the declines, which had bitcoin down8.4% in 24 hours and ETH down more than 11%.
But those were built on earlier drops that also followed Musk's abrupt criticisms of the electricity used in the digital mining of bitcoin -- and reversing an earlier moveto allow for vehicle purchases using bitcoin.
""To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it cant drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal,"" he wrote last week. It's unclear why he had suddenly grown concerned about the use of energy in bitcoin mining.

"After 24% Pop, Why Redditors Could Keep AMC Stock Rising
Ethers rally this year has added some $300 million to the wealth of Russia-born Vitalik Buterin, Ethereums co-founder and the worlds youngest known crypto billionaire.
Everyone is in it to be like Vitalik. I dont own Ethereum. I asked some investors to convince me why I should.
Vitalik...not quite a full ""moon"" for Ethereum. But many investors see it doubling from where it is
... [+]
KMR Images
EthereumMoon?
Ethereums growth is attributed to an increasing number of developers building decentralized finance(DeFi) applications on the Ethereum blockchain platform. The rise of non-fungible tokens(NFT) also increases demand for Ethereum.
Lastly, continued institutional interest in treating crypto like any other security also helps ETH. Coinbase is the new NYSE. ETH is No. 2 on Coinbase after Bitcoin.
Seeing how the DeFi and NFT movements are directly connected to Ethereum, their increased activity has been the main driver for ETH prices in 2021, says Moss. Users need ETH to interact with these technologies, so the more people who are involved with these communities and protocols, the higher the value of ETH goes, he says.
Where is ETH going?
told Business Insider
that ETH could eventually reach $40,000. This is the most bullish call I have heard. Others in the crypto space see it doubling.
We predict that the price will most probably double from its current state by the end of 2021 to hit over $8,000 per coin, says Ivo Grigorov, co-founder & CEO of Credifi, a DeFi lending marketplace based in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Judging by the current momentum of the cryptocurrency space and the increased interest in Ethereum, our price target may easily be overtaken, Grigorov said in an email correspondence. More investors and developers are discovering ETH or moving onto the platform in search of a more robust, stable and secure investment vehicle.
For newcomers to the cryptocurrency market and its companies, Ethereum is a platform where developers can build apps favoring the easy creation of other alternative coins. An altcoin is basically any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin, so ETH is an alt.
Ethereum is the name of the underlying blockchain technology or network, while Ether (ETH) is the digital currency that powers the platform. Ethereum can be described as the open source platform of cryptocurrency, just like Googles
GOOG
Play Store or Apples
AAPL
App Store, Grigorov says.
Just like in Bitcoins blockchain, each Ethereum transaction is confirmed when the nodes (participants) on the network reach a mutual consensus that this particular transaction took place and they are rewarded in ETH for their work, through a process known as mining. Mining can be easily described as solving/computing a complex algorithm in order to prove the authenticity of previous transactions on the network.
As an investor, one of my top list cryptocurrencies to buy is definitely ETH, Grigorov says. The upgrade to ETH 2.0 should spur more growth and give investors massive benefits.
Thats Ethereum. The update to the Ethereum network, known as the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 introduces a base fee to Ethereum transaction fees, something all users are required to pay when they send a transaction. This proposal introduces a burnwhich  simply put  would allow for coins to be burnt or eliminated, thus reducing supply.
I wont pretend to understand all the computer technicals, but ETH 2.0 is looked at as a positive upgrade to the network, and therefore
good for investors.
If we're still bullish by the end of the year, I'd say ETH would be closer to the $10,000, thinks Ioannis Giannaros, Co-founder of Wyre, a cross-border payment API using blockchain technology based in San Francisco. If we're in a bear market, we'll see lows back in the $1,400s, he says.
Like a traditional security, what goes up, must come down.

Danial Daychopan
, CEO and founder of London-based DeFi firm Plutus says theres been a lot of fear of missing out when it comes to Ethereum. Investor inboxes have been flooded with something akin to Ethereum mooncalls all month.
FOMO has played a big part, but a lot of this is driven, too, by the rush of smart money and thousands of developers around the world buying ETH, he says. Developers need ETH to pay for building their applications on the Ethereum network. Think of it as a toll fee, where the biggest computer in the world charges you tolls for using its immutable cloud servers and verifying every transaction you make on it.
The crypto investing story is the perfect get-rich quick scheme. Its those specialty lose weight or gain muscle diets that never work; its the YouTuber selling you his stock picks from his Ferrari driver seat.
But if we assume crypto is a fad, trending to $0, the opportunity cost for thinking that way is through the roof.Everyone recognizes this.
If you invested a measly $100 in ETH in December 2015, youd have over $125,000 today. Only those who believe in flying rainbow unicorns think they will ever make 125,000% on ETH again. Besides, they would likely sell if was up 100%. But true believers think they have a chance at 10,000% gains in five years. And why wouldnt they? Look at what these coins have done so far.
If ETH does reverse this week, there will be buyers on the other end, thinking the long game. Unless you believe the long-term result is the Ethereum blockchain being centralized, and everything associated with it becomes worthless.
If youre an investor, just know there are at thousands of crypto losers out there, says Daychopan. Crypto has matured a lot, but its still the Wild West of investing. There are meme coins and projects that are there simply to take your money. Do your own research, invest in the future, but be patience and follow the smart money. The results will be in your favor if you do that.

QuickSwap  The DEX Curating An Economical and Scalable Way to Swap Tokens
The rise of decentralized finance has massively boosted the number of transactions occurring on the  blockchain. It led to the congestion on the network and users paying higher gas fees to process their transactions. The cost to execute a trade has gone so high that it made even smaller DeFi operations, like token swaps, completely unviable. While Vitaliks brainchild transitions from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoW), it remains a distant dream for all DeFi users.
In Retrospect, QuickSwap was Inevitable
The tradeoffs of a blockchain are passed on to the projects building on top of them. This is what happened with Uniswap, the worlds first decentralized token swap platform. It was the first decentralized exchange (DEX) of the crypto space, which attracted the community for its decentralization and ability to process trades without asking its users to go through rigorous KYC/AML processes. However, with all of the advantages UniSwap offers, its users suffer from high gas fees due to it being built on the Ethereum blockchain.
A simple transaction on Uniswap now often costs more than the transaction itself, leaving a gap that needed filling. QuickSwap was quick to address the issues plaguing Ethereum-based DEXs, by offering much lower transaction fees and almost instant block formation time.
A Brief Overview of QuickSwap
QuickSwap is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade any ERC-20 tokens. Though the DEX is based on Ethereum, it is powered by the Polygon network, which provides several benefits not seen in other similar solutions. For example, QuickSwap can trade any of the ERC-20 tokens listed on its platform with almost no gas costs and at lightning-fast speeds, making QuickSwap (and Polygon) a great accompaniment for UniSwap and Ethereum.
Moreover, anyone can list any ERC-20 token on QuickSwap by providing liquidity to enable token swaps. In return, the platform rewards them with a 0.3% transaction fee (out of which 0.25% goes to the LPs, 0.04% to the dragons lair (which is the QUICK staking pool), and 0.01% goes to QuickSwaps treasury (to fund development). In addition to the trading fee, liquidity providers can earn QuickSwaps native governance QUICK token  which they can use to create, vet, and vote on proposals relating to the running of the protocol. They can also use QUICK tokens to stake in the Dragons Lair to earn additional QUICK.
Quantifying QuickSwaps Traction
The integration with Polygon has made QuickSwap a liquidity magnet as it exceeds the TVL (total value locked) of all layer-two-based decentralized exchanges.
Though the DEX is just seven months old, it has attracted more than $500 million liquidity to date. Besides, QuickSwap has a 24-hour trading volume of more than $200 million  a feat that is nearly impossible to achieve in a short period.
Furthermore, QUICK, the governance token of QuickSwap, surged from under $1 to $1585 in just six months. The token is currently trading below its all-time high, and the price it achieved is a dream for many other digital assets of its category.
Taking a Big Slice Out of DeFi Space
Uniswap has seen over $2.68 billion in volume with the number of users dipping to 78.05k. On the other hand, QuickSwap has seen over $148.18 million while the number of users has increased to 11.48k.
Uniswap Users
QuickSwap Users
Comparing the most popular exchange puts QuickSwap success into context. However, it is equally important to understand how young the DEX is.
Factors Driving the Success of Polygon-powered DEX
Just like other leading decentralized exchanges, QuickSwap enables permissionless listing, non-custodial trading, and community governance. However, a few features make it entirely different from its predecessors, for example 
Layer-two transactions: A Plasma-based Layer 2 solution, Polygon fuels QuickSwaps entire ecosystem, meaning tokens can be exchanged within about two seconds at a fraction of the gas cost on the Ethereum network. Therefore, QuickSwap transactions have the security of Ethereum and the massive scale capabilities of Polygon.
High yield on liquidity: QuickSwap enhances the crypto pooling experience by offering a high annual per yield (APY) to users who pool their tokens to provide liquidity on the platform. As per the data from APY.vision, QUICK was among the top five tokens as of May 12, 2021. With its pair of wrapped Ethereum, liquidity providers can earn a yield of as much as 188%. However, the exchange boasts even higher APY with other digital asset pairs. For example, the ETH/USDC pair on QuickSwap can bring in ~306% APY, while the  pair is currently earning about 251%.
Ending Thoughts
The growing interest of users in DeFi coupled with the delay of ETH 2.0s launch has attracted many to the Polygon network. While the market is full of challenging solutions, most of them are either too centralized or hardly deliver on their promises.
The exponential growth of QuickSwaps user base, price, and TVL is proof that the crypto community has accepted QuickSwap as a go-to DEX. Since it uses the Polygon network for token swaps, users can enjoy a much lower trading fee and quicker block confirmation times  all that while getting high APY for providing liquidity.
However, the DEX is still in its infancy. Though it has demonstrated much to the crypto community, QuickSwap still has more to prove. Considering its growth since its inception, it seems the exchange is right on its track of replacing old finance.

About Ethereum
Ethereum
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. It launched on July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 115,901,565 coins.

According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

"On May 12, the 27-year-old founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin donated cryptocurrency worth $1.5 billion to COVID-19 relief efforts in India and several other non-profits.   Buterin became the world's youngest known crypto billionaire just last week when Ether's value crossed the $3,000 mark, making his Ether holdings alone add up to just over $1 billion.   Here's how he donated to India's COVID-19 relief.  Besides holding significant amounts of Ether, Buterin also owned enormous quantities of Shiba Inu coin, Dogelon Mars, and Akita Inu. All three cryptocurrencies are based on the legendary Doge meme and their value has skyrocketed hot on the heels of Dogecoin, the original memecoin.   Crypto relief for India started when Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal proactively launched a crypto-based COVID-19 relief campaignIndia COVID-Crypto Relief Fund.  Nailwal's move also prompted Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan to donate $50,000 in Ether. Vitalik Buterin followed with a 100 Ether transfer worth $600,000.   Srinivasan also pledged $50 per retweet of his appeal up to $100,000.   Buterin then transferred another 400 Ether and 50 trillion Shiba Inu coins then worth $1.2 billion to Nailwal's campaign.  Interestingly, Shiba Inu coin's anonymous creators gifted Buterin half the total coins to ever be produced, provided he never sold them. After Buterin donated to Nailwal, Shiba Inu's value plummeted 40% amid fears Buterin was liquidating assets.   Nailwal thanked Buterin on Twitter and assuring Shiba Inu investors, he wrote: We will not do anything which hurts any community specially the retail community involved (sic).  Besides donating to Nailwal, Forbes reported that Buterin sent around $441 million of Akita Inu to Gitcoin, a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain.   Additionally, Buterin donated 13,292 Ether to GiveWell, all Dogelon Mars tokens and 1,000 Ether to Methuselah Foundation, 500 Ether to the Charter Cities Institute, and 1,050 Ether to Machine Intelligence Research Institute.  GiveWell is a nonprofit charity evaluator while the Methuselah Foundation reportedly backs efforts in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies. Machine Intelligence Research Institute reportedly works to make Artificial Intelligence technology safer and Charter Cities Institute is a public policy research organization. A day after Buterin's donations, Coinbase recorded that Shiba Inu fell 40%, Dogelon Mars plummeted 65%, and Akita Inu lost over 50% of its value.   This means that the recipients received much less than Buterin intended to transfer.   Further, Nailwal's assurance to Shiba Inu investors means he won't be able to dispense tangible COVID-19 aid as rapidly as it is required.  Ironically, even Indian fintech startup Cred successfully encouraged users to part with Cred coins earned by timely payment of credit card bills. The company then supplied 1,000 liters of medical oxygen per 10,000 coins donated. This was nevertheless the butt of jokes on social media. Meanwhile, India continues to grapple with a shortage of hospital beds and medical oxygen amid a humanitarian crisis.   When COVID-19 relief is needed, donations in the form of tangible goods that can immediately be mobilized are immeasurably more valuable than donations of nearly unusable virtual assets tied to market volatility.   Nevertheless, we appreciate the gesture and understand that Buterin cannot control the markets.",2021-05-16,0.9956,0.15,0.031,0.819

According to CryptoCompare, Poa Network is a public sidechain based on the Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will feature the Proof-of-Authority algorithm, which does not depend on the nodes solving mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of authorities, pre-selected validators that will be able to seal the blocks and secure the network. The validators identity will be public enabling any third party to check their identity. The Poa Network will allow organizations to build their own networks with their own validators and developers to deploy DApps. On April 28, 2018, the POA Team announced the launch of a cross-chain bridge that gives users the ability to send POA tokens back and forth between the POA Network and the Ethereum network. POA Bridge went live on May 10. The POA to Ethereum transfer will result in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user will also have the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network.

As the meme-friendly Dogecoin has showed us, the next hot cryptocurrency can come from almost anywhere. While the majority will undoubtedly be volatile, I don't think we have seen the last of crypto mania, and I am sure there are other growth tokens that will emerge. It will be important to split them into two pots: Those that have real-world utility like Ethereum, and those that are more artificially inflated, like Dogecoin, which may be able to stick around even though it doesn't currently have any unique technical advantage over other tokens.
The one I would like to talk about here is called Theta Token
(
CRYPTO:THETA
)
, which is used on the decentralized Theta Network that seeks to improve inefficiencies associated with video streaming. Is it worth your investment dollars?
How does Theta blockchain work?
The Theta blockchain is a decentralized infrastructure that seeks to improve video streaming and delivery.
Companies or websites providing video streaming content have traditionally kept it all in one centralized system. While this may be convenient at first, if enough viewers try to access the content all at the same time and put pressure on the system, the stream can become slow and choppy. To remedy this, streaming providers will opt for a content delivery system, in which they disperse a group of servers so viewers don't put as much stress on one single access point, ensuring a smoother stream. But this can be costly.
Theta blockchain is seeking to disrupt this model by essentially setting up a peer-to-peer network that taps into people's computers to utilize their unused bandwidth. Now, when someone attempts to view content that is available on the Theta Network, some of the data powering that content will come from the main server hosting it, while some will come from the Theta Network.
Image source: Getty Images.
Many in the industry do not view Theta as a competitor to other video streaming sites, but instead as a way to improve the plumbing behind the system, lowering the cost of streaming.
""Theta's innovation is set to disrupt today's online video industry much in the same way that the YouTube platform did to traditional video back in 2005,"" said Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and an advisor to Theta. ""One of our biggest challenges had been the high costs of delivering video to various parts of the world, and this problem is only getting bigger with HD, 4K and higher quality video streams.""
Additionally, Theta has made several big partnerships. For instance, Samsung plans to include the Theta.tv e-sports streaming network in future Galaxy S20 smartphones, and also may bring other Theta-powered content platforms to its own smart television platform. Major companies like Sony and Creative Artists Agency are also backing Theta, as well as several venture capital firms.
There are two types of tokens utilized on the Theta Network.
The first is called TFUEL, which is how Theta pays people for extending their computer's bandwidth into the network. That's right -- when a person uses their computer to share content with someone viewing it on the Theta network, and hence helps improve streaming quality and loading time, they are compensated in full or partial TFUEL, which is currently trading for roughly $0.34 per token.
The second is the Theta Token, which is referred to as the governance token of the network. Theta tokens are more akin to shares, and holders of these will supposedly be responsible for the direction of the project going forward.
Interestingly, Theta Token has arguably had a better run than Dogecoin. The coin, which currently trades at $10.74 per token, had at one point this year climbed more than 17,000% from its price early last year. It recently had a total market value around $10 billion, making it the 20th-largest cryptocurrencyas of May 14.
Is it more like Dogecoin or Ethereum?
You can probably surmise that I view Theta Token to be more like Ethereum than Dogecoin. While it did have the kind of run-up that Dogecoin did I think it was much quieter and less meme-powered. Also, not only does Theta Token have a real-world and unique utility like Ethereum, but it also has a set supply of 1 billion tokens, all of which are in circulation right now, which is good for investors because it can create more demand. While the Theta Token will likely be volatile and there is certainly no guarantee, I see a lot more potential with this one than other tokens that have appreciated greatly.

"The 4 Biggest Mistakes You Can Make When Buying Ethereum

Ethereum is on the rise. If you're planning to buy some of your own, here are the mistakes to avoid.
Like many cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has been growing in valuesince last year. But in the last few weeks, its price has gone through the roof. It recently set a new all-time high by trading at over $3,500.
Ethereum has consistently ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. With the recent price increases, you may have decided that now is the time to buy Ethereum. Before you do, learn about a few common mistakes that some new buyers make.
1. Not buying through a reputable crypto exchange
There are more ways than ever to buy Ethereum. Cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase are the traditional option. There are also apps and online stock brokers where you can get Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.
Not every option is a good one, though. Fake cryptocurrency exchanges pop up with the sole purpose of stealing people's money. And even legitimate ways to buy crypto may have excessive fees or restrictions. PayPal and Venmoare notable examples: Although you can buy some cryptocurrencies through these apps, fees are high, and you'll be unable to move your crypto out of the app after you buy it.
The Ascent's picks for the best online stock brokers
Find the best stock broker for you among these top picks. Whether you're looking for a special sign-up offer, outstanding customer support, $0 commissions, intuitive mobile apps, or more, you'll find a stock broker to fit your trading needs.
See the picks
If you're new to buying crypto, the simplest way to stay safe is by sticking to the best cryptocurrency exchanges In particular, look for an exchange that offers insurance and keeps most of its crypto in cold storage, meaning it's offline.
2. Not researching Ethereum first
Before you commit your hard-earned money to Ethereum, take some time to learn about it. This is a smart rule of thumb for any investment. You don't need to be an expert in Ethereum, but it helps to know how it works and what makes it unique.
Knowledge of Ethereum is especially important because of how volatile it is. Odds are that there will continue to be significant price movements in the future. When you understand Ethereum and you believe in its value, you're less likely to be influenced by the trends or the current price.
3. Trying to time the market
Considering Ethereum is near an all-time high, it's tempting to wait until the price drops before you buy. You may find yourself thinking that you'll wait until it drops below a certain amount, and then make your investment.
The problem is that no one can accurately time the market. There's no guarantee that Ethereum will drop to your target price. Maybe it keeps increasing, which could leave you regretting that you didn't buy right now. Or, imagine that the price does drop significantly. That would give you the opportunity to buy low -- unless you start second guessing your decision because you're worried the price will decrease even more.
If you're going to buy Ethereum, look at it as a long-term investment. Buy because you believe the price will rise in the years to come, not in the hope of getting rich in a matter of weeks.
4. Putting all your money into it
Most cryptocurrencies are volatile, higher-risk assets, and that includes Ethereum. The returns have been fantastic so far, but that can change quickly. After Ethereum peaked at over $1,200 in 2018, the price sank to under $100. It took over three years before Ethereum broke the $1,200 mark again.

Start investing
To minimize your risk, make sure you diversify your investments. A good guideline is to reserve 5% to 10% of your portfolio for crypto. You could use that entirely for Ethereum, or you could include multiple cryptocurrencies. For the rest of your portfolio, stick to investments with less volatility and a longer track record of success, such as mutual funds
This is an exciting time in the history of Ethereum. The price is rocketing upwards, and Ethereum's blockchain technology is being used more and more. Ethereum could turn out to be a sound investment -- as long as you avoid costly mistakes.

"Blockchain: One string to rule them all?
Thu, Mar 29, 2018 - 5:50 AM
Joe Kim
THE potential of blockchain's impact could be far reaching, especially since Gartner estimates that blockchains will create at least one business worth US$10 billion by 2022. At the same time, some pundits claim the ledger-based model which powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could literally end poverty.
That's a lot of potential for what is essentially a new method of record-keeping. In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has announced that it was partnering R3 and a consortium of the world's largest financial institutions to launch Project Ubin, a digital cash-on-ledger project.
In addition, Singapore Airlines is also rolling out later this year a system where Krisflyer frequent flyer miles can be used for purchases at retail outlets, through a digital wallet app that employs blockchain-based technology.
WHY SO PRECIOUS?
sentifi.com
Market voices on:
Blockchains are essentially lists of records, but more importantly, blockchains can offer us something that's sorely missing in today's digital world: trust. Each record, or ""block"", is linked to others by a cryptographic algorithm, forming a ""chain"" of connected records. By changing any individual block after it joins the chain, you'll end up altering all of them. Therefore, they are nearly incorruptible and are capable of transforming not just financial transactions, but the fundamentals of how humans digitally interact with organisations and one another.
Google 'working on blockchain-for-cloud tech'
At present, our digital identities are by and large fragmented. To determine whether an individual or business can be trusted, we reconcile numerous records from different sources. Think of the various background checks, credit scores, and other hoops you jump through to prove you can be trusted with a bank loan, for example.
Using blockchains, these different records can demonstrate how they relate to one another without requiring those high-intensity checks and balances. In other words, the blockchain becomes a marker that says: ""this data can be trusted"".
An example is a digital identity for every Singapore citizen which the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) is developing. It serves as a form of software-based security token. Besides better protecting online identities, it can also allow users to ditch multiple e-banking tokens with different banks, and do away with the hassle of remembering different usernames and passwords.
Eliminating traditional data verification processes could transform almost every aspect of business. Organisations that keep huge volumes of sensitive records no longer need to worry about misplacing or accidentally modifying their information.
Blockchains can not only detect if that happens, but demonstrate to regulators the integrity of such records. Industries where transactions touch numerous other entities, like the airline industry, no longer need to go through rigorous and time-consuming data reconciliation; the cryptographic elements of blockchains essentially verify themselves. Any business dealing in personally identifying information, from health care to e-commerce, can use blockchain to prove beyond reasonable doubt to customers that their data is indeed secure.
Blockchains provide an elegant solution to the problem of trust: if you verify one block of data in the chain, you verify all of them. And like the One Ring of Tolkien's saga, a blockchain can't be duplicated or broken. Perhaps blockchains will someday rule over all data - but adopting them, like their Middle Earth equivalent, also comes at a price.
IN ADOPTION, BIND THEM
It takes many blocks to build a chain - and each of them can cause an organisation to stumble. If Bitcoin has taught us anything, it's that blockchains are only as good as the underlying performance of the systems that encrypt, track, and reconcile them.
When these systems crash, either because the volume or complexity of chains involved grows too large, the business value bound up in these blockchains also disappears. And if their security gets compromised - as happened with Mount Gox, once the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world - so too do the basic operations of any businesses relying on them.
How can we avoid these Mount Doom (or Gox) scenarios? Organisations will have to treat blockchain adoption like any other IT project. The infrastructure beneath it will need to be scalable, speedy, and secure - even more so because of the sheer amount of data and value at stake.
CLOUD PROVIDERS
I expect that most blockchains will soon operate through an ""as-a-service"" model, mainly through large cloud providers. While various organisations are currently pursuing private ledgers, these will inevitably struggle to meet the performance, durability, and cost-efficiency that cloud-hosted blockchains - like most other platforms in the cloud - will provide. Private blockchains will also prove harder to adapt to different applications and data, meaning businesses that invest in their development may meet an innovation dead-end faster than those who opt for publicly hosted chains.
Ultimately, the success of any blockchain platform will hinge on its ability to deliver high throughput, low latency, and a frictionless user experience - just like any project since the dawn of IT. With the sheer amount of hope and value placed on blockchains, IT will need to maintain even greater visibility of their systems than the All-Seeing Eye. Fortunately, the same basic rules for IT success still apply: monitor your infrastructure performance, optimise your various networking and storage systems, and always assume your platform is less secure than you want it to be. Even the seemingly indestructible One Ring had a fatal vulnerability to exploit.

/PRNewswire/ -- Zap.org a platform that empowers smart contracts with data, has partnered with Stox, an open source, Ethereum-based prediction market platform, to provide real-world data about events listed on Stox's prediction market. The data will be delivered to the blockchain to allow the smart contracts operating behind the scenes of the Stox platform to read and use that data.
Zap's oracles will provide trusted, reliable, and quality reporting of events followed by customers of the Stox prediction market. By adding Zap oracles, the Stox prediction market becomes fully decentralized. The usage of Zap's oracle data in a prominent blockchain platform such as Stox, will instill trust in the developers considering using the Zap platform. Showcasing such prominent customers, data providers will be incentivized to list data on the Zap marketplace to reach key customers.
""Decentralization is valued by blockchain users because it is seen as a form of data protection, and it is a major selling point for blockchain platforms,"" said
Yossi Peretz
, CEO of Stox. ""Our blockchain-based prediction market proves how a prediction market can work with an oracle marketplace to not only bring real world data onto the blockchain, but to allow developers and speculators to arrive at a consensus about future events, as well.""
Zap offers developers a way to find the data they need to build their smart contracts/Dapps from a wide range of sources, mitigating the risks involved with trusting a single source for data. Although centralized ""web 1.0"" prediction markets exist, decentralized blockchain-based alternatives will prove to be superior.
""We believe the decentralized nature of a blockchain-based platform helps safeguard data using a cryptographic, consensus-based system. Blockchain-based prediction market platforms like Stox are distinct because they aim for a high level of decentralization,"" said
Nick Spanos
, co-founder and Team Leader of Zap. ""The usage of Zap oracles in a mainstream Ethereum platform, like Stox, will give other developers the confidence they need to trust the Zap platform and use data/oracles they find on our marketplace. This is merely the first step to empower people to disrupt the enterprise corporations and banks that have historically stifled innovation.""
The Zap Project is solving one of the biggest challenges in the blockchain industry  the need for oracles that can provide smart contracts with access to off-chain data. The partnership highlights the importance of decentralization protecting strong data for smart contracts.
About ZAP
ZAP is an ethereum-based ERC-20 token powering an oracle marketplace for smart contracts. The platform's mission is to foster the creation of a standardized and self-sustained platform-agnostic smart contract data layer enhanced by the world's best open marketplace for oracles, dramatically lowering barriers to entry into the multi-billion dollar alternative data industry and the smart contract ecosystem. The Zap project is managed and directed by the Synapse Foundation, whose mission is to oversee development, increase community engagement, and sponsor participation within the Zap ecosystem.

Ethereum Classic continues to descend
Ethereum Classic shows the formation of lower highs and lower lows since May 6. This downward move accelerated on May 12 as ETC slid nearly 28% in a single day.

"Business Insider
reported that Former Ark Invest analyst James Wang predicts ETH could reach a price value of $40,000. Other crypto analysts see the price doubling.
By the end of 2021, ETH is expected to at least hit over $8,000 per coin, per Forbes.
Ethereum and its ETH coins are predicted to continuously rise in value because of its platform's ""open source"" nature, similar to how Google and its Play Store continue to grow.
However, Ethereum is taking security measures against malicious attacks from some cryptominers.
Coinmarketcap
added that an update on the Ethereum network known as ""Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559"" incurs a transaction fee from its users. This is compared to a toll fee for the traders whenever they gain access to Ethereum's network, computer systems, and immutable cloud servers that verify every transaction you make in ETH.
Note, however, that developers need to pay when building their application on the Ethereum Network. Although expensive, Ethereum is building up to long-term stability and investing in its future.
Ethereum Stock
If you ever tried investing $100 in ETH back in December 2015, you could have owned $125,000 today! Fortunately, Ethereum still plans to build up its success with what is predicted to be a 100 percent rise, or even 10,000 percent rise in five years.
If you plan on investing in Ethereum, now might be the best time. However, also remember that there are thousands of crypto losers out there. The cryptocurrency market remains erratic, where trading could suddenly rise and fall. Take this prediction with a grain of salt when analyzing Ethereum's possible price boost.

Buterin  who came into the possessionof 505 trillion SHIB tokens last week  burned 90% of the remaining tokens in his wallet, according to a transaction record on Ethereums blockchain on Etherscan.io. It should be noted that the remaining 50% of SHIB is lockedto Uniswap (UNI).
Burning refers to the act of sending a token to an unusable account and removing it from circulation, which diminishes supply and increases its scarcity.
The Ethereum co-founder sent 410.24 trillion SHIB tokens from his wallet, valued at $6.74 billion at the time of the transaction.
I've decided to burn 90% of the remaining shiba tokens in my wallet. The remaining 10% will be sent to a (not yet decided) charity with similar values to cryptorelief (preventing large-scale loss of life) but with a more long-term orientation, wrote Buterin in the transaction hash.
Covid is a big problem now, but it's important to think about the longer term future too!
SHIB traded 4.29% higher at $0.000016 at press time. It has a circulating supply of 394.8 trillion coins, as per CoinMarketCap. The total supply is one quadrillion.

ETH traded 9.93% lower at $3,435.05 at press time on a 24-hour basis, while the apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin(BTC) traded 5.95% lower at $45,143.70.
Why It Matters: Buterin praised dog token communities in the transaction saying Plenty of dog people have shown their generosity and their willingness to not just focus on their own profits but also be interested in making the world as a whole better.
The Ethereum co-founderalso had a message for creators of coins and urged them not to give him coins in their projects without his consent.
I don't want to be a locus of power of that kind. Better to just print the coins into the hands of a worthy charity directly (though do talk to them first), said Buterin.
SHIB touts itself as a Dogecoin (DOGE) killer and skyrocketed last weekas it found love from investors in China. DOGE traded 6.08% lower at $0.50 at press time.
Benzingas Take: SHIB has gained 19% on a seven-day trailing basis, but still traded 57.07% lower from the all-time high of $0.0000388, which it reached on May 10, at press time. Buterins burn could potentially trigger another rally, but that remains to be seen. Investors should exercise caution and do due diligence before allocating funds to any volatile investments like new cryptocurrencies with small market capitalizations and high supply.

"Why Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Just Burned 410 Trillion Shiba Inu Coins

Ethereum co-founder and crypto billionaire Vitalik Buterin has destroyed $7,023,342,984 worth of the Shiba Inu coin ($SHIB) in a move that looks promising for investors in the latest meme coin.
DISLCAIMER: The author of this article is not a financial expert and nothing in this story should be taken as financial advice. Consult a financial expert before investing.
Just days after donating $1.5 billion worth of SHIB to the India Covid-Crypto Relief Fund,Buterin sent 410,241,996,771,871.894771826174755464 coins to a dead wallet address, which effectively destroys them.
The now-destroyed coins account for a whopping 41% of the total SHIB in circulation.

Alongside the transaction Buterin left a note for the SHIB community:
Ive decided to burn 90% of the remaining Shiba tokens in my wallet. The remaining 10% will be sent to a (not yet decided) charity with similar values to cryptorelief (preventing the large-scale loss of life) but with more long-term orientation. COVID is a big problem now, but its important to think about the longer-term future too! he wrote.
Simply holding the remaining coins in the 0xab58 wallet forever was never an option; for security reasons alone they would have to be moved to a better wallet eventually, and any transaction I make would get interpreted as an action. So may as well do the useful thing immediately.
Ive actually been impressed by how the dog token communities have treated the recent donation! Plenty of dog people have shown their generosity and their willingness to not just focus on their own profits but also be interested in making the world as a whole better. I support all who are earnestly doing that.
But for anyone making coins (or daos, or whatever else) in the future, PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ME COINS OR POWER IN YOUR PROJECT WITHOUT MY CONSENT! I dont *want* to be a locus of power of that kind. Better to just print the coins into the hands of a worthy charity directly (though do talk to them first).
Its worth noting that Buterins holdings in SHIB were gifted to him by the coins founders at launch as a marketing tactic. So ultimately, Buterin had nothing to lose.

Trump Has Blown Off Rudy Giulianis Pleas for Help as Feds Circle
Drew Angerer/GettyIn the weeks since the feds raided Rudy Giulianis apartment and office in late April, close allies have tried to ferry a slew of emergency requests to former President Donald Trump and his advisers.But according to three people familiar with the matter, Trump, as well as several of his legal advisers and longtime confidants, have been hesitant about swooping in to help the embattled Giuliani, who for years worked as Trumps personal lawyer, a political adviser, and attack dog. Giuliani also served as a major player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and as a key driver in the former presidents efforts to nullify Joe Bidens clear victory in the 2020 election.Team Trumps reluctance to intervene comes at a time when federal investigators have ramped up their probe into whether Giulianis Ukraine-related work during the Trump era amounted to an unregistered and illegal lobbying operation on behalf of foreign figures. So far, no charges have been brought against the former New York City mayor as a result of this investigation, which began in 2019. Trumps silence has led to simmering frustrations among members of Giulianis inner orbit, who privately allege that the ex-presidents team is working to convince him to hang Giuliani out to dry in his hour of need.Its a question now of whether or not [the former president and his team] want to leave Rudy to fend for himself or if theyre going to take a stand against this, one person close to Giuliani said last week. Right now, we dont know.Among Giuliani allies pleas, the three sources said, have been for Trump to issue a strong verbal or written statement saying Giulianis work during the Trump-Ukraine saga was done on behalf of then-President Trumpand therefore not part of an illegal foreign lobbying effort. In other words, Trumps corroboration would be more than good public relations for Giuliani, it would back up a key pillar of Giulianis legal argument that he wasnt lobbying and is innocent of the allegations.Other asks have included having the ex-president sign on to a legal motion to have federal investigators throw out any seized communications that Giuliani and his lawyers argue are covered by attorney-client privilege. Further, there have been repeated requests that Trump and his team financially aid Giulianis ballooning legal defense and help cover the mounting, sizable expenses.Two people close to Trump say they have urged the former president to lay low on the matter and to refrain from making too many statements or commitments on Giuliani and the federal probe. These people have told Trump that its unclear what the feds have and that any statement could backfire both on him and on Giuliani. Moreover, various people in Trumps social and political orbits have been trying to convince the former president for years that Giuliani has been too great a liability for him, and they have suggested that he cut the lawyer loose.Even Parts of Trumpworld Are Like: Rudy, WTF Are You Doing?Many of them still blame Giuliani and his Ukraine shenanigans for getting Trump impeached the first time, and the attorney helped lead the Trumpworld and GOP charge in falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from the 45th U.S. president. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, both Trump and Giuliani have been slammed with lawsuit after lawsuit over their roles in firing up the mob that committed the anti-democratic assault.In recent weeks, Trump himself has argued behind closed doors that he wouldnt want to say Giuliani was doing all of the Ukraine workwhich included a trans-Atlantic dirt-digging expedition on the Biden family that led to Trumps first impeachmenton Trumps behalf, according to one of the people close to the former president. Trumps reasoning, this source relayed, is based in the ex-presidents insistence that he didnt always know what Giuliani was doing during the Ukraine effort or concocting with his Ukrainian pals, several of whom Trump has privately dinged as idiots.It is also unclear when or if Trump will ultimately sign on to the desired legal motion, with allies to Giuliani expressing consternation over how the ex-president and his lawyers have not jumped at the opportunity.On Sunday, Robert Costello, Giulianis longtime attorney, said, We do not know what, if anything, President Trump will do, when asked by The Daily Beast whether Trumps legal team would intervene in the effort to scuttle the search warrant. Costello said Giulianis attorneys have not formally asked Trumps legal team to do so. They can make up their own minds, he said.He added that neither he nor his client has asked Trump to make a statement since federal agents seized Giulianis electronic devices.Alan Dershowitz, a celebrity lawyer who served on Trumps legal team during the first impeachment trial, is now actively counseling Giuliani and his attorneys. Ive said to them that it would be very good to get people [including Trump] whose materials might have been seized to... become part of the [motion], Dershowitz said in a brief interview.The two sources close to the former president each said Trump has repeatedly expressed sympathy for Giulianis ongoing woes but has not committed to overtly assisting his personal lawyer yet. Another person familiar with the situation told The Daily Beast that Giuliani has said he remains convinced that Trump wont abandon him and will step up when the time is right.Over the decades and during his presidency, however, Trump has cemented a reputation for regularly turning his back on close allies and one-time loyalists, including when legal or political pressures became too hot for him. Chief among these former allies is one of Giulianis bitter rivals, Michael Cohen, another former personal lawyer and fixer of Trumps. Cohen turned on his former boss after he felt abandoned by Trump following a 2018 federal raid and has since become an enthusiastic witness for federal investigators whove been looking into Trump and his business empire.Dead to Each Other: Team Trump Prepares to Bury Michael Cohen, Weakling and TraitorWhen federal agents executed a search warrant on Cohens office in 2018, Trump intervened in the case and hired attorneys who argued that they should be allowed to review seized materials for privileged attorney-client materials before prosecutors could. Whether Trump will intervene similarly in a case involving the warrant against Giuliani remains to be seen.Trump did jump in to help some advisers after the authorities came knocking, including Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort, all of whom received presidential pardons within the final month of Trumps term in the White House. In December, The New York Times reported that the then-president had discussed with people close to him the prospect of issuing a pre-emptive pardon to Giuliani and talked with Mr. Giuliani ",2021-05-17,0.8689,0.07,0.058,0.872

"Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency by popularity and market cap. And yet, the CEO still does not believe that Ethereum is worth putting money in. Even going as far as picking a meme coin over ETH.
Jack Endorses HamsterCoin
HamsterCoin is another one of the many meme coins that are currently flooding the market. Responding to a tweet that said Dogecoin was the biggest threat to Ethereum, Dorsey replied that HamsterCoin was a bigger threat.
5 BTC + 300 Free Spins for new players & 15 BTC + 35.000 Free Spins every month, only at mBitcasino. Play Now!
After the tweet, the price of the meme coin HamsterCoin grew by a tremendous 250% in a matter of hours. This comes as no surprise given the trend of influential people tweeting support for meme coins and seeing the prices surge. The most prominent case of this is with billionaire Elon Musk and his tweets about Dogecoin.
Ethereum struggles to hole $2,000 point | Source:
ETHUSD on TradingView.com
HamsterCoin which is a meme coin built on the Binance Smart Chain has no unique use case. There is no groundbreaking technology behind the token. It simply promises financial freedom to its users. The coin does not support any smart contracts. And furthermore, there is no security of decentralization like there is with Ethereum.
Despite the obvious downsides of the coin, investors rushed to accumulate the coin. Pushing the price up in a short period of time.
Are Meme Coins Better Than Ethereum?
The answer to this question is a simple no. Meme coins usually have no use cases besides pumps and dumps. Investors go into these coins looking to make a quick buck. And sometimes, it does not always work out in their favor.
Comparing meme coins with Ethereum usually just helps to give notoriety to the coins. The more you attach a big name to a small coin, the more people pay attention to that coin. So, comparing a coin like HamsterCoin to a coin like Ethereum is a marketing move.

In fact, other companies, like Fidelity, Cathie Woods ARK Invest VanEck, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and a dozen asset managers have application filings pending at the SEC to launch a Bitcoin ETF.
Scaramucci also shared that his hedge fund is about to announce an ETF for a digital innovation fund that contains publicly traded assets that are linked to Ethereum, Bitcoin and other coins.
He also gave his views on the crypto space and how he expects it to evolve in the following year.
I think that well be sitting here a year from now, therell still be skeptics, still be people that are fence-sitters, but there will be slightly more people in the pool with us and, as a result of which, the prices will be higher. And I just think this is one of those weird assets where the higher the prices go, the more people are going to be drawn into the pool.
Scaramucci is not alone in his opinion that cryptos like Ether and BTC will rise in value. Sentiment among Gen Z and millennial investors, who  make up more than 90% of the crypto market, that the space is the future of currency remains high.

Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Burden of proof still rests on the BTC bulls
Resistance levels under the microscope this week as the cryptocurrency majors stumbled at established barriers. Bitcoin price retracted from crucial $35,500 level, Ethereum price stalled at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,237 and XRP price strength was paralyzed by the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.733. The constructive technical developments of last week have not released the momentum to confidently bust through higher resistance levels, putting attempts to disentangle from the recent churn on hold.
VeChain price stuck in tight range, VET will go sideways for the rest of the summer
VeChain price has not been able to go higher after the recovery from $0.04 towards $0.16.VET corrected further down and is looking for support from buyers.The area around $0.1 is forming a heavy cap on the possible further upside for Vechain. VeChain price looks to be in a difficult spot with upside potential very limited, but even for sellers, it doesnt look appealing to go short VET.
Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB investors need their eyes on the prize as 30% rally awaits
Shiba Inu price activated the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on June 28. Nonetheless, the breakout was short-lived, and SHIB has fallen into a consolidation, releasing the overbought conditions on the lower timeframes. If the rookie cryptocurrency can sustain a rally above the declining 50-day SMA, it could rally 33% before striking meaningful resistance.

) with a capitalization of nearly $250 billion. That puts roughly 95% of the S&P 500s large-cap stock constituents to shame. And while it might be in second place by some measures, its the crypto markets top dog in other meaningful ways.
Ethereums utility proposition for todays digital decentralized finance (DeFi) market is without equal. Dont take my word for it though. Street smart billionaire businessman Mark Cuban has credited ETH with cryptocurrencys strongest functionalityand smart contract technology, which will ultimately overshadow Bitcoins use.
The support is nice to have. But in a disruptive but also ever-evolving crypto market, what works today is no guarantee of future leadership, let alone survivorship. Enter Cardano and its ADA cryptocurrency.
The History and Technology of Cardano
Created in 2017 by one of Ethereums co-founders, ADA obviously deserves some built-in consideration. Today, theres more than 10,000 digital assets out there. And besides ETH, Bitcoin and the joke token called Dogecoin (CCC:
DOGE-USD
), most investors would be hard-pressed to name even one other cryptocurrency.
Given Cardanos important lineage to the crypto markets second largest technology, ADA should raise eyebrows the way a new company created by Microsofts (NASDAQ:
MSFT
) Bill Gates might. And in fact, Cardano is proving its worth. The platforms open source proof-of-stake blockchain has been gaining critical mass for incredibly good reasons.
Cardanos technology is faster and less energy intensive than its competition. And whether that technology is used to guard against counterfeit retail goods or allow agriculture companies to track produce from the seed to your stomach, the functionality is important.
The news gets better for ADA investors too. Cardano is in the process of testing an upgradecalled Alonzo.
Cute name aside, the build will enable smart contract blockchain. Along with Cardanos existing scalability and cost advantages over Ethereum, this also allows for many Dapps (decentralized applications) to switch over to Cardano.
To be fair, Cardano isnt the only potential Ethereum killer on the block. Polygon (CCC:
MATIC-USD
) is another top contender for that title. And Ethereum isnt simply resting on its laurels either. A more robust version of the blockchain known as Ethereum 2.0 is in development to resolve the networks own shortcomings.
Cardano Monthly Price Chart
Charts by TradingView
Its important to remember that this is a period of early technological innovation. Few of us have even used a digital asset for anything other than a trading vehicle  spend some money on some tokens, wait for the price to rise, and then sell for a profit. Therefore, we also need to take a serious look at the ADA price chart.
As with any crypto investment, ADA is meant to be smartly traded for short-term gains. The hope is that a smaller stake after taking partial profits might turn into the life-changing investment variety. Today, a purchase to begin that kind of campaign might be possible.
Following Mays volatile correction off the tokens all-time-high, ADA formed an inside monthly candlestick With Junes price action also taking the shape of a bullish hammerformed off trend and 62% Fibonacci retracement levelsand centered on the contracts prior 2018 high, anticipating a meaningful bottom has decent-looking support working in its favor.
I wouldnt be a buyer of ADA just yet though.
Today, and as the monthly view also reveals, stochasticshave turned bearishly over due to an overbought condition. What Id demand from a purchase is for ADA to continue holding above the 50% level and trend support. The secondary indicator should, at a minimum, be doing something other than pointing down in neutral territory.
Ideally, a bullish crossover with the ADA token just crossing its former high would be the wish list entry. Thats so momentum is purchased, rather a falling knife. But life is hardly perfect and in this type situation, Id settle for flat if ADA finds its way back above 2018s prior high.
Bottom line, should those conditions more or less be met, Id then advise managing that investment like it was the last $1.40 or so in your pocket, rather than just blindly cheering the trade and possibly being left holding the bag.

Ethereum
, however, is still the leader in that realm and based on a few recent developments, its use cases appear to be on the rise.
Much of the attention in the cryptocurrency space is often on bitcoin, given that it is the maiden coin and blockchain. Ethereum, however, is a close second, and it is starting to follow in the footsteps of its larger peer. Lets take a look.
Ethereum ETF
The ink has barely dried on ARK Investments application for a bitcoinETF, and an Ethereum exchange-traded fund might not be too far behind. According to a recent The Scoop podcast Anthony Scaramuccis SkyBridge Capital plans to file for an Ethereum ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Scaramucci said its anybodys guess when those things will be going. SkyBridge also launched a separate private Ethereum fund on July 1. An Ethereum ETF would strengthen the use case of the second-biggest cryptocurrency even further, which bodes well for the Ether price.
U.S. regulators have been slow to approve a bitcoin ETF so far, much to the industrys chagrin. Developers have continued to innovate regardless of relentless swings and misses for regulatory support.

The Ethereum community is already quite bullish on the Ether price and doesnt need another reason to stick around.

So far, out of more than 500 votes, nearly half are not expecting Ethereum to catch up with bitcoin. Close to a third of participants, however, are willing to bet it could happen in the coming years. The poll is running for several more days.
According to Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin in an
with CNBC, persistent downturns in the crypto market are gone for good. From now on, he said, crypto winters will last just a few weeks to a few months before recovery gets underway.

New York, July 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Grayscale Investments   the world's largest digital currency asset manager and manager of Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (OTCQX: GDLC) (the Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for the Fund in connection with its quarterly review.
In accordance with the Fund's construction criteria, Grayscale has adjusted the Fund's portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase Cardano (ADA). This announcement follows  the April 2021
news
that Grayscale adjusted the Fund's portfolio and purchased Chainlink (LINK).
""We are excited to welcome Cardano to our Digital Large Cap Fund's portfolio as we work to ensure that our diversified Fund can safely hold assets that collectively comprise 70% of the entire digital asset market,"" said Edward McGee, Vice President of Finance at Grayscale. ""Digital currencies represent a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, and at Grayscale, we are proud to provide our investors with access to leading digital currencies through regulated, familiar product offerings.""
Cardano is a smart contract platform created by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum. Informed by academic research, Cardano aims to improve upon the scalability, security, and efficiency of Ethereum by using a novel proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. ADA is the native token of the Cardano network that allows holders to engage in peer-to-peer transactions and stake as collateral to contribute to the network's consensus mechanism.
At the end of the day on July 1, 2021, the Fund Components were a basket of 67.47% Bitcoin (BTC), 25.39% Ethereum (ETH), 4.26% Cardano (ADA), 1.03% Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.99% Litecoin (LTC), and 0.86% Chainlink (LINK) and each Share represented 0.00044919 Bitcoin (BTC), 0.00263059 Ethereum (ETH),0.71069603 Cardano (ADA), 0.0046159 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.00160755 Litecoin (LTC), and 0.01053027 Chainlink (LINK). The Fund does not generate any income and regularly distributes Fund Components to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of Fund Components represented by each Share gradually decreases over time.

Ethereum has stuttered in its pursuit of surging above the $2,300 level of resistance, subsequently falling back to the $2,000 level of support following a gruelling 11.64% sell-off over the past 48 hours.
The worlds second largest cryptocurrency has now re-established itself in a bearish posture on both lower and higher time frames, with the potential of a major correction to below $1,000 still on the cards before the end of the year.
Sundays weekly candle close beneath the 21 exponential moving average was the first since April, 2020, demonstrating that momentum in the long term is most certainly heading to the downside.
One glimmer of hope for Ethereum is the upcoming EIP 1559 update scheduled to go ahead later this month. As with most major news events, Ethereum will likely rise on a hype-fuelled rally going into the event, before crumbling to new lows afterwards.
ETHUSD chart by TradingView
In order to regain a bullish posture, Ethereum needs to close this weekly candle back above the 21EMA at $2,155. Failure to do this will likely result in a slump back to the $1,700 level next week.
Much of it will also depend on the trajectory of Bitcoin, which appears to be struggling to gain a foothold in the $30,000 to $40,000 range after suffering a rejection at $36,500 on Tuesday.
If Bitcoin loses the $30,000 level of support, the entire cryptocurrency market will struggle as a result, especially as Bitcoin dominance has steadily risen following the drop to $30,000 in May.
Short term levels of support for Ethereum remain at $1,875, $1,700 and the previous all-time high of $1,450.

About Ethereum
Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterinon July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.
Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldnt get buy in to his proposal.

"Cardano: Fundamental Analysis
Background
Cardano is a blockchain project with over 70% of the total currency, ADA, staked for network validation (a really impressive rate). Part of the reason that so much ADA is staked is due to the cryptocurrencys lack of smart contracts. While Ethereum has around 5% of its total supply locked as validators, much more ETH is locked in DeFi applications
The Cardano project began in 2015 in an attempt to solve some of the problems that Ethereum faced from its Proof-of-Work consensusmodel. Cardano was officially founded by Charles Hoskinson, who is a former co-founder of Ethereum.
Some of Cardanos key improvements are multiple processing layers for settlements and computations, proof of stake consensus and the ability to upgrade its network easily in the future.
The Cardano settlement layer launched in 2017 and raised around $63 million through the ADA ICO. The settlement layer excludes smart contracts, so at this time Cardano could only be used for settling peer-to-peer payments. Since then, the ever-growing team of developers has been hard at work preparing for the launch of smart contracts on the Cardano Computation Layer.
Cardano Development
Cardano currently has between 100 and 150 developers actively working on the project and pushes out around 700 commits per week. These factors make the cryptocurrency one of the most actively-developed projects in the blockchain space today, suggesting that they will be able to deliver on their development roadmap.
This level of developers places Cardano among the most likely projects to steal market share from Ethereum. However, its still not close to the size and pace achieved by Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos as seen below in the Electric Capital Developers Report from 2020
Cardano Smart Contracts
Cardano plans to add support for smart contracts in the 3rd stage of its development roadmap, known as Goguen With smart contracts being developed on other blockchains like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Cardano has some catching up to do. 1 of the most common critiques of Cardano is its non-existent DeFi ecosystem. The project will need to deploy smart contracts in order to support decentralized finance applications, as smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi.
Cardano smart contracts will run on the Cardano computation layer, which will support legacy Solidity contracts as well as its own language, Plutus
Partnerships
Cardano has already inked some notable partnerships with universities, governments and businesses including the University of Illinois, Ethiopia and New Balance. Hoskinson has pushed hard to see Cardanos potential to come to fruition in Africa, where he believesblockchain can make a huge impact. This is in part due to a large proportion of Africas population being unbanked.
New Balance also has plans to use Cardanos network to track the authenticity of its shoes.
Cardano vs. Ethereum
As Etheruem faces continued delays along the way to its 2.0 overhaul, many investors see Cardano as the solution. Ethereum 2.0 will upgrade Ethereums network from proof of work to proof of stake, which may cause Cardano to become obsolete. Cardano can process many more transactions than Ethereum due to its proof of stake consensus, but this may not be the case with ETH2.
Also, Cardano doesnt have any smart contracts on its network. Smart contracts are a critical factor in the success of a blockchains ecosystem. With Ethereum already having more than $30 billion dollars in cryptocurrency locked into smart contracts, Cardano may be late to the parade.
Pros for Cardano
Cardano is already proof of stake and has a strong development team behind its future upgrades. The project focuses on getting it right the 1st time, whereas Ethereum focuses on trial and error to develop its ecosystem.
Cardanos separation of the settlement and computation layers results in much lower transaction fees which are already much lower than Ethereums.
Cons for Cardano
Cardano is fighting an uphill battle with an army a tenth the size of Ethereums. Competitor Polkadot also has a much larger development team and is growing even quicker.
Low fees are nice, but low fees also indicate a low level of demand for space on the network.
Cardano also has yet to implement its own smart contract system, and has no chance to overtake Ethereums smart contract market share until they launch.
Pros for Ethereum
Etheruems network is already established and boasts over 1,500 active developers (over 10 times more than Cardano). Ethereum is the foundation of the DeFi movement, and it boasts a rich ecosystem already built on top of it. If Cardano wants to defeat Ethereum, they will need to pick up the weight of this entire ecosystem as well (This is why Cardano has already promised to support smart contracts written in Ethereums programming language, Solidity).
Ethereum is also far more decentralized than Cardano, making it much more secure (even before Ethereum 2.0, which should heighten security). Also, the ETH2 testnet, essentially the beta version, is already more decentralized than Cardano.
Cons for Ethereum
Ethereums lengthy transition to proof of stake is giving their competitors time to catch up and gain market share. Ethereums high network fees also make it unusable for many of its potential users. Since Ethereum only has 1 layer for settlements and smart contracts, the blockchain relies on scaling solutions like Polygon Optimism and Arbitrum to scale its network. That is, until ETH2 releases.
Where to Buy Cardano
Cardano is available almost anywhere you can buy crypto. You can pick it up on Binance.US, Kraken and even Coinbase as of May 2021.

What is Ethereum?
Ethereum, the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is like Bitcoin's agile little sibling. It uses less energy and has faster transactions and more business applications.
Many digital currencies run on Ethereum's platform, which launched in 2015. A new, improved, version called ""Eth 2"" is being rolled out in stages. It will support more transactions per second, consume less energy, and have enhanced security.
One big difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that its blockchain ledger has smart contract capabilities. Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that allow an action to be performed when certain conditions are met.

Find the best stock broker for you among these top picks. Whether you're looking for a special sign-up offer, outstanding customer support, $0 commissions, intuitive mobile apps, or more, you'll find a stock broker to fit your trading needs.
See the picks
For example, a smart contract in a digital book might set out what royalties should be paid when the book is sold. Or it might mean an insurer automatically pays out in specific situations, without any need for the client to file a claim. Payments could also be set up to transfer automatically as goods move along stages in a supply chain.
Should you buy it?
Like every investment -- but especially crypto investments -- there are risks involved with buying Ethereum.
For one, its price is volatile. You might see dramatic gains, but you might also see heavy falls. Also, since cryptocurrencies are a new type of investment, it's difficult to judge which coins will perform well in the long term.
I put a small amount of money into crypto each month. But before I started, I first built up my emergency fund I also made sure my new crypto investing didn't come at the cost of my retirement contributions
These moves ensure I'm only investing money I can reasonably afford to lose. That way, if the price of cryptos collapses tomorrow, I can wait for it to rise again. And if it doesn't, I can stomach the losses.
Where you choose to invest should depend on your own priorities and strategy, but here are the reasons Ethereumcould be interesting.
1. Many things run on Ethereum
Ethereum underpins a lot of the exciting applications of blockchain technology. It's designed to be used to create new coins and run smart contracts. Plus, right now, you need to own Ethereum if you want to do other things -- such as trade on some platforms or buy NFTs If the crypto world continues to grow, so should Ethereum.

2. Eth 2 will be more environmentally friendly
One concern I have about crypto is the environmental cost. To validate and confirm transactions, a number of cryptocurrencies use a proof-of-work (PoW) model, which uses a lot of energy.
Right now, Bitcoin uses about 130 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy each year, which is about the same amount of energy as countries like Ukraine or Argentina. Ethereum uses about a fifth of that amount, but it's still as much as a small country like Ecuador.
Eth 2 will move from the carbon-costly PoW model to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model. I won't go into the technical details here, but estimates suggest the new mining model could cut its energy consumption by 99%.
Eth 2 will also be easier to scale and more secure, which is a bonus.
3. I can stake my Ethereum
One way to earn interest on your crypto is through staking.
Staking involves tying up your coins for a set amount of time so that they can be used to mine more coins. One challenge is that there are limited staking windows. Once they are full, you have to wait for another window.
I don't have that problem with Ethereum. Right now, many top cryptocurrency exchangeswill let you stake until the Eth 2 limits are reached. In doing so, you'll also be part of the Eth 2 development.
The downside? Your Ethereum will be tied up for an undefined amount of time, which could be as long as two years. Since I plan to hold my Ethereum long term, I'm comfortable with this -- especially as I'm earning about 8% interest on my staked coins.
What are the risks?
We've already touched on the general risks of cryptocurrencies. There are also some Ethereum-specific risks to be aware of.
First, Ethereum is not the only cryptocurrency to offer smart contracts. Currently, several coins are operating in this market. They include:
Neo
VeChain
EOS
And if these coins can do it better, there's a chance they could knock Ethereum off the top spot.
There's also the ever-present danger of hacking. Not only could the exchange or hot wallet where you store your currencies be hacked, but so could the Ethereum network itself.
That's why it's better to be safe than sorry. As with any investment, don't just take my advice -- or the advice of anyone on social media. Do your research and try to understand what the cryptocurrency you're interested in actually does, and what its long-term potential is.
Using the wrong broker could cost you serious money
Over the long term, there's been no better way to grow your wealth than investing in the stock market. But using the wrong broker could make a big dent in your investing returns. ",2021-06-19,0.9996,0.18,0.048,0.771
"Myth 1: EIP 1559 is aimed at reducing high fees on Ethereum.
Ethereum Fees Vary Sharply
Source: Coin Metrics
At its core, the aim of EIP 1559 is to make transaction fees less volatile and more predictable by creating an algorithmic model to automatically adjust costs by a factor of 1.125x at most per block.
Under the current blind auction-like system for determining fees on Ethereum, the costs for sending a transaction can skyrocket at a moments notice depending on the ups and downs of the crypto markets. Under EIP 1559, fees are regulated to increase and decrease based on the use of block space. If blocks are filled above a set gas target, the base fee will increase by 12.5% and vice versa.
See also:
CoinDesk Researchs Metrics Report Explaining Ethereum Gas Costs
These changes to the inner workings of Ethereums fee model are not expected to reduce transaction fees on Ethereum, however. The issue of high fees is primarily caused by limited network capacity to process transactions. EIP 15559 on its own will not affect how many transactions the network is able to handle at once.
Myth 2: EIP 1559 will make Ethereums monetary policy more predictable.
EIP 1559 introduces a fee-burning mechanism that will permanently remove coins from the total circulating supply of ether(ETH). The reason for burning the base fee rather than distributing them to Ethereum miners is to ensure there is no financial incentive for miners to artificially congest the network and keep the base fee high.
Because of this burning mechanism, EIP 1559 may strengthen a bitcoin-like narrative of limited supply to the investment case for ether. It is difficult, however, to predict exactly how much ether will be burnt over time given that the base fee dynamically adjusts according to network activity and demand for block space.
ETH Supply Growth Is Theoretically Unlimited
Source: Coin Metrics
While EIP 1559 introduces a counterbalance against an ever-increasing ether supply, it doesnt make Ethereums long-term monetary policy more stable. On the contrary, it introduces economic instability to the network by making it impossible to control what the total supply of ether will be over time.
Myth 3: It is likely that EIP 1559 will cause Ethereum miners to quit and attack the network.
It is estimatedthat miners will lose 20% to 35% of their income with the activation of EIP 1559, and so there have been petitionsfrom mining entities on Ethereum to stop EIP 1559 in its current form from being accepted into the London upgrade. In addition, amendments to EIP 1559 have been proposed. Those includechanging the proposal so that the base fee is not burned, increasing miner income from other sources such as block subsidies and making adjustments to Ethereums mining algorithm so that competition for network rewards among miners is more equitable.
Despite the opposition from members of the Ethereum mining community, EIP 1559 is expected to be released on Ethereums main network in July, which raises the question of whether miners could potentially resist the London upgrade by shutting down their machines and weakening the security of the network.
While that is possible, there are a number of reasons why it is unlikely that the majority of miners will defect or try to sabotage Ethereum as a result of EIP 1559 activation. One of the primary reasons is that miners would have to forgo rewards they might have otherwise earned by upgrading their machines and continuing operations. There is also the reality that miners have a limited runway on Ethereum and will have to forgo 100% of rewards once the network switches to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol early next year.
See also:

Myth 4: EIP 1559 will solve the issue of miner extractable value (MEV) on Ethereum.
Miner revenue on Ethereum has historically consisted of a fixed block subsidy and transaction fees. However, as a result of the growing popularity for high-frequency trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), miner income from MEV has become increasingly lucrative. Research and development organization Flashbotsestimates daily income from MEV has grown from half a million dollars at the start of this year to over $6 million in June.
High-Frequency Trading on DEXs Boosted Miners' MEV Income
Source: MEV-Explore Flashbots
As background, MEV is the income that miners can earn as a direct result of their ability to order transactions within a block. It is difficult to quantify because miner revenue made from reordering, including or censoring certain transactions within a block, can come anytime a user interacts with another user or application on Ethereum.
See also:
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of MEV on Eth 2.0
EIP 1559 reduces the ability for miners to rely on transaction fees as a way to extract MEV from users, but the ability for miners to order transactions and thereby earn MEV through other means will remain unchanged under EIP 1559. Speaking to the continued need for research and development on MEV after EIP 1559 activation, Flashbots researcher Philip Daian saidduring a virtual Ethereum conference in May:
The transaction fees people are paying for inclusion [in a block] are actually a very small percentage of the eventual MEV market  The game is still fundamentally unchanged and the deeper protocol level mitigations are still things that we havent explored yet.

") is one of nearly 5,000 cryptocurrencies and has recently attracted investors attention. Its utility has helped it stand out from the crowd, but MATIC is overvalued for its financials.
Source: Shutterstock
It seems that today, everyone with the appropriate technical knowledge and a vision can create an altcoin out of nowhere. Unsurprisingly, that means large number of cryptocurrencies are dead or will become extinct in the future. When the hype is over and demand cools, logic returns to capital markets and investors make wiser decisions  like selling off disappointing cryptos.
Could MATIC survive in this volatile sector to become the new hot cryptocurrency? That remains to be seen. I expect radical changes will soon come for the industry, including regulations and stricter taxation of crypto ownership. With that in mind, lets take a closer look at Polygon.
MATIC Is Doing Surprisingly Well for an Unknown Coin
MATIC recently underwent a name change. This year, the network was renamed Polygon as it expanded its mission to become Ethereums (CCC:
ETH-USD
) Internet of Blockchains.
Is this new brand name a better one, and can it add value to MATIC? Or is it just a marketing trick? Rebranding is meant to add value to the company. Its an opportunity to conduct further research, use new marketing channels and change up core values to achieve the companys goals. But its unclear how Polygons new name will impact the network.
I am astonished that as of June 17, Polygon is ranked 15th on CoinMarketCap The price of MATIC is at $1.51, and the market capitalization is at $9.4 billion. Since when are billions of dollars so easily made in the investment world? This price makes a virtually unknown altcoin seem more valuable than established, publicly traded companies with attractive dividends.
Many crypto investors seem to mistakenly derive an altcoins value from its public price. It is as if they choose to defy the common rules of investing, and the resulting surge in altcoin prices are the new norm. Well, the trend is not normal and will be over soon  and the majority of cryptocurrencies will take a hit as the market corrects.
With this in mind, it seems that Polygon is targeting this group of investors. But does that mean crypto fans should discount the altcoin?
The Story of Surging Altcoin Prices Repeats
Most altcoins follow a repetitive price pattern. They remain on a flat line for a long period of time. Then, out of the blue, they start a meteoric ascent  almost a 90 degree angle on their chart  and early traders are rewarded with massive gains.
In late January, MATIC token was trading at 4 cents. In May, it reached the price of $2.45. Then early investors took their profits and the price corrected by more than 50%. When did early trading in altcoins become so profitable?
The answer is that trading has not been so easy and profitable. I get the idea of investing $100 in something worth 4 cents. Even if the price falls to zero and you lose the $100, its no big deal. But with investments, it is a big deal in the sense that your loss is someones else gain.
MATIC has followed the altcoin price trend, and its early investors have already taken their gains. But for those looking to invest now, is the altcoin still worth it? A quick look at the network itself may help investors decide.
The Basics of MATIC and its Network
Polygon tries to solve the scalability and fee problems of Ethereum by offering instant blockchain transactions. It hosts decentralized apps and aims to simplify interactions between users. In theory, this is interesting  I believe it could work well.
In addition to its scalability, Polygon boasts a high throughput, user-friendly experience, security, asset interoperability and a one-stop DeFi platform. The network has an extensive toolkit for developers, as applications are part of its core business strategy.
Polygons goal is to build a framework that connects Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks and improves their compatibility. I see the value in this, and why investors were drawn to the network and its MATIC coin.
MATIC Is Overvalued Despite Strong Utility
Despite its strengths, enthusiasm about its utility can hardly justify the price of MATIC. It seems as if the altcoin solved all of Ethereums problems at once and its price skyrocketed. Even when you factor in the upsides of its tech, the value of the coin still doesnt match its price.
MATIC is another altcoin that defies the logic of investing, so beware of its largely-speculative recent surge. I recognize the numerous benefits of Polygon, but need to see more business progress before I can justify its $9.4 billion valuation. At least MATIC has utility, but for now, its price is too high from any perspective.

Holo(CCC:
HOT-USD
) has done quite well this year, despite falling significantly off of its April 4 peak of 2.848 cents. On June 3, it was at 0.8854 cents. That means Holo has fallen 68.9% from its peak. Some believe that Holo crypto will rebound this year and approach its former peak, but I am skeptical.
Source: Grey82 / Shutterstock.com
The crypto ended last year at 0.06403 cents, according to Coinmarketcap.com In June, it was at 0.8854 cents per HOT token. That means its price is now 13.8 times its price at the end of 2020, a gain of 1,283% year to date.
So here we have a crypto asset that has proven its ability to rise quite significantly year-to-date. But its well off its peak price, implying that a rebound could be profitable. For example, if Holo crypto were to rise back to its peak of 2.848 cents, it could see a potential gain of 222%.
However, Holo still has a market capitalization of $1.574 billion. This ranks it as 63rd in the Coinmarketcap universeof cryptocurrencies. At yesterdays price of 0.8854 cents, HOT is over 59 times its initial coin offeringof 0.015 cents in 2018, when Holo raised $20.65 million.
Holo is not a top-10 crypto, but it is not insignificant, either. Lets look at its prospects more closely.
Holos Standout Features
ETH-USD
) based blockchain protocol that is a distributed peer-to-peer hosting platform for Holochain apps (hApps.) These apps can be downloaded on personal computers to earn HOT tokens.
Holochain makes a big deal about the user autonomy built directly into its architecture and protocols. That is the key to its claim of a distributed network as a data platform.
Holochain bills itself as an easy platform to build apps. Here is what the company said
in 2019 on Medium
:
 most activities people currently do on the web are possible to build on Holochain. Its fast enough and scalable enough to run the likes of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Reddit, and so on. In order for these kinds of apps to be valuable, though, they need to be accessible to everyone, not just users running Holochain software. Thats where Holos hosting system comes in.
In other words, Holochains platform is easy to build on with hApps similar to existing Internet apps. Obviously, the key difference is that they are distributed applications  not controlled by any one company, but by the hApps users and developers.
Holo plans to disrupt the crypto app space. The company claims its peer-to-peer distribution of the blockchain can avoid scalability issues that existing platforms face. By parceling blockchain ledgers out to many different people, Holo can avoid congestion in both blockchain processing and storage.
AsCoingecko points out, every device on a network is capable of functioning independently Data synchronization is only required when necessary or agreed upon by users.
What To Do With Holo Crypto
Lets get practical. There do not seem to be many Holochain apps. Githublists a number of them. The most recent one seems to be Holochat.
Moreover, the number of Holo addresses is low. According to Glassnode.com, there are only 1,876 active Holo addressesas of May 3. That is nothing compared to the 671,710 addressesEthereum had as of the same date. In other words, Ethereum has 358 times the number of Holochain addresses.
On the other hand, consider this: Ethereum has a market value of $315.5 billion. That is 200 times Holochains market cap of $1.57 billion. But given the 358 times address differential, one would expect the market cap to be roughly that size. This might imply that Holo is a bit overvalued now.
That is a static way of looking at the differential. If Holos address creation growth rate is higher than Ethereums, then the price differential might be explained. Right now I cannot determine the exact rate, but I suspect that Ethereums is much higher than Holochains.
So for the time being, I believe that Holo crypto is fairly valued. Carefully monitor the address rate differential. If a hApp takes off and the rate is strong, one could invest in the crypto sometime before the end of the year.

"Bitcoin price releases to the upside from a bear pennant pattern before quickly reversing.
Ethereum price defines a bear pennant pattern that is triggering to the downside today.
XRP price holding the lower trend line of a bear flag pattern.
Bitcoin price flashes bull trap as bearish pennant attempts to resolve to the upside with limited commitment and emotion. Ethereum pricefalls short of the double bottom trigger after closing May with a long-legged doji pattern. XRP price fails to maintain the psychologically important $1.00 and now projects notable downside for the international settlements token.
Bitcoin price unable to capture investor attention
Bitcoin price had been defining a bearish pennant patternon the daily chartsince May 19, before attempting a breakout to the upside yesterday. Today, the breakout was quickly reversed, creating a bull trap and raising the odds that BTC is now primed to sell through the pennants lower trend line at $34,603.
The attempted breakout emerged with Bitcoin price at more than 80% of the horizontal distance from the base to the apex, indicating a weaker pattern or less robust continuation. Based on historical precedent, the best price thrusts develop when price is between half and three-quarters of the horizontal distance.
The measured move target for the bear pennant continuation pattern is $18,320, representing a 47% decline from the BTC pennants lower trend line at the time of writing. The target is based on the length of the flagpole preceding the pennant. The target coincides very closely with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the March 2020 to April 2021 advance at $16,920.
To achieve a sell-off to the target, Bitcoin price will need to dissolve support at the 61.8% retracement of the March 2020 to April 2021 rally at $27,175, followed by the 2017 high at $19,891.
BTC/USD daily chart
The bear pennant shaped below the intersection of multiple resistance levels that will challenge Bitcoin price for days and weeks to come if the pennant breakout to the upside regains traction. The resistance includes the 38.2% Fibonacciretracement of the historic rally from the March 2020 low to the April high at $41,581, the January 8 high at $41,986, the February 28 low at $43,016 and the 38.2% retracement level of the April-May decline at $43,331. Adding to the substantive resistance is the convergence of the 200-day SMA at $41,578.
With Bitcoin price upside potential limited to 8%-14% and downside potential of nearly 50%, BTC presents a high reward, low-risk opportunity for bearish investors.
Ethereum price stumbles, improving fundamentals take a backseat to technicals
Similar to Bitcoin price Ethereum price defined a bearish pennant patternthat initially released to the upside on June 3 but was met with notable resistance at the 50-day SMA at $2,898. ETH has reversed the breakout attempt and is now testing the pennants lower trend line at $2,580.
Since the ETH pennant pattern resolved near the apex, the power of the continuation should be questioned if a downside breakout does emerge. Based on the flagpole heading into the pattern, the measured move target is $1,257, yielding a 51% decline from the position of the lower trend line today.
The magnitude of the potential Ethereum price decline will slice through the May 23 low at $1,728, the 200-day SMA at $1,713 and the 2018 high at $1,419.
ETH/USD daily chart
If Ethereum price can register a daily close above $3,000, the outlook turns neutral for ETH investors and places the smart contracts token on the path to test the 61.8% retracement of the May correction at $3,369 and then the 78.6% retracement at $3,815.
As price is dictating today, the environment for the cryptocurrency complex is highly fluid and vulnerable to wide-ranging price swings. The bearish tilt in the Ethereum price outlookcould flip very quickly, so investors need to be agile and disciplined in their ETH position sizing.
XRP price toys with investors searching for a timely long opportunity
To review, XRP price illustrated a cup-with-high-handle baseon the four-chart, with a measured move target of $1,539, delivering a 40% return from the handle high at $1.10. The development of the pattern had been consistent with successful historical precedents, defined by rising volume on the right side of the cup and then progressively lower volume through handle construction.
The optimistic cup-with-high-handle base failed to materialize after it was voided today with the 8% decline. XRP price is now trading below $1.00 and at the lower trend line of the larger bearish flag pattern. A failure to hold leaves Ripple exposed to a test of $0.800 and then the 200-day SMA at $0.701.
The measured move target of the Ripple bearish flag pattern is $0.432, offering investors a 53% decline from the position of the flags lower trend line today. It is calculated using the length of the flagpole preceding theflag. A drop of that magnitude leaves XRP price stuck in the legal uncertainty price range that followed the November 2020 high into the December 2020 low.
XRP/USD daily chart
If XRP price closes above the 10-week SMA at $1.164, it will be areversal of fortune for investors.
XRP price action has failed to achieve any significant trading outcomes, excluding the May 23 low bounce. Ripple has wrestled with the negative overhang of the broader crypto marketwhile trying to piece together the interesting fundamental story into a compelling narrative for investors.

"electrifying surge -- it's down about 35% from its recent all-time high. However, Cardano has kept more of its upswing action intact amid increased market volatility.
Image Source: Getty Images.
Cardano isn't as well-known as Bitcoin or Ethereum, and its market cap and daily transaction volume are a fraction of those leading coins. But that's part of the appeal: cryptocurrency investors see vast potential in the so-called ""Ethereum killer,"" which is on the verge of a massive blockchain network upgrade that could help it live up to that moniker.
Here are five reasons why investors are so bullish on Cardano right now.
1. It's getting much smarter
Cardano will soon implement ""smart contract"" functionality, which essentially means adding code that enables automated, self-executing contracts. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps on top of blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum's enormously popular Uniswap decentralized exchange. The entire decentralized finance (DeFi)industry is built on smart contracts, much of it on Ethereum, and Cardano is about to join the party.
2. Cardano can handle high demand
Ethereum's blockchain can only handle a very limited number of transactions right now -- around 15 per second -- which has led to immense congestion on the network. That means longer waits to complete transactions and high ""gas fees"" (or transaction fees) that you'll pay to send them through.
Future network upgrades should ease that pain, but Cardano is already primed to handle much larger volumes of transactions. It has been tested at up to 257 transactions per second, but Cardano developer Input Output is looking into much vaster tallies -- potentially as many as 1 million or more transactions per second.
3. It's environmentally friendlier, too
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on energy-intensive ""proof-of-work"" systems, which require miners to use powerful computers to solve complex math equations -- all in the hopes of winning some cryptocurrency for their efforts. In fact, it's part of the reason why the crypto market is down so much lately, after Tesla decided to stop accepting Bitcoindue to the outsized environmental impact of mining.
Luckily, Cardano has a much more eco-friendly ""proof-of-stake"" system, in which validators hold their coins within the network to participate and earn rewards. According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, the network is ""1.6 million times more energy efficient"" than Bitcoin. That might seem like an impossible figure, but it really speaks to the overwhelming amount of energy needed to power Bitcoin's network. It's something that crypto newcomers are surely keeping in mind as they plot potential investments, and Cardano offers a better path forward.
4.Cardano is peer-reviewed
As a third-generation blockchain network, Cardano has learned from the missteps of its predecessors to try and create a more effective, economical, and energy-efficient system. On top of that, it's also based on peer-reviewed scientific research, with ample time and energy put into exploring the technical possibilities within. You might call it the opposite of Facebook's classic ""move fast and break things"" motto. Some would say that's why Cardano has been slow in implementing features like smart contracts, but it could assuage some investors' fears given the already volatile nature of cryptocurrency.
5. It still feels early
If bullish cryptocurrency analysts are correct, then the entire market may have plenty of room to grow in the years and decades to come. But the days of buying a single BTC or ETH for a few dollars and watching it grow into the thousands (and beyond) are long gone. Could Cardano's value ultimately lift off into the stratosphere like those coins did? There's no telling for now. But the fundamentals behind Cardano appear to be strong, and given the current low price per coin, many investors see it as a worthy long-term bet on a promising cryptocurrency project.

"Ethereum
(ETH/USD) is showing strong bullish momentum as mentioned last time. The angle of the uptrend has only accelerated recently (blue arrows).
However, yesterdays daily candlestick closed as a Doji which indicates indecision. Is this a first sign of a reversal? Lets review.
Price charts and technical analysis
The ETH/USD uptrend seems too strong for a reversal to take place now:
The gaps between the moving averages (MAs), the angle of the MAs, and the gap between price and the 21 EMAs all indicate a strong uptrend.
The Doji daily candlestick indicates indecision and it is more likely to create a potential sideways pullback (grey arrow) or retracement (orange arrow) in the uptrend.
The support zone (blue box) is likely a bouncing spot (blue box) for more upside (green arrows).
Only a deeper retracement places the bullish outlook on hold (orange) or invalidates it (red circle).
On the 4 hour chart, price action made a bearish pullback to and bounce at the 23.6% Fibonacciretracement level:
After completing a 5 wave pattern (blue) in wave 3 (orange), price action is probably building a wave 4 pullback (orange).
The 23.6% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels remain key for the potential wave 4 (orange) pattern.
A bull flag pattern (grey arrows) could indicate a shallow pullback and uptrend continuation (blue arrow).
A deeper pullback (orange arrows) will probably test the Fibonacci support levels.
The targets of the uptrend are located at $4750, $5000, $5500.
A break below the 50% Fib places the uptrend on hold (yellow button) whereas a deeper retracement invalidates it (red button).

Unlike Bitcoin, Cardano's cryptocurrency, ADA, does not require energy-intensive mining. Image source: Getty Images.
Cardano is the dark horse of crypto that may surprise us all.
Cardano (ADA)
describes itself as a third-generation cryptocurrency. Like Bitcoin (BTC), the world's first digital currency, it uses blockchain technology But unlike Bitcoin, it is faster, more scalable, and doesn't consume as much energy. Here are some fun facts about Cardano:
1. Cardano's token is named after the world's first computer programmer
Cardano's creators have a love of names. Each step of the platform's development roadmap is named after a famous poet, writer, or computer scientist.
ADA, Cardano's native token, takes its name from Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and a 19th-century mathematician. Many believe Lovelace's thinking laid the foundations for modern-day computing.
2. It uses a fraction of the energy of Ethereum or Bitcoin
Bitcoin and Ethereum's (ETH) energy consumption has been in the spotlight recently after Elon Musk said Tesla would suspend Bitcoin purchases due to environmental concerns
Bitcoin uses about the same amount of energy as the Netherlands each year. Ethereum's consumption is less than half Bitcoin's, but it's still the equivalent of a smaller country like Portugal.
In contrast, Cardano is an eco-friendly crypto which consumes about the same amount of energy as 600 U.S. homes each year. Ethereum does have an upgrade in the works which would cut its consumption by 99.95%. But Cardano's green credentials have been baked in from the start.
3. Cardano is working with governments in Africa
There are many ways blockchain could impact lives One of Cardano's founding principles was to solve real-world problems, such as economic accessibility.
It has had a team based in Ethiopia for several years, traveling and building relationships with governments and ministries across the continent. Its recent flagship deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education is its biggest project yet.
This partnership uses the Cardano platform to create digital IDs for 5 million students. It will give each student a secure and tamper-proof academic record that stays with them for life. As they move into the workforce or college, that ID will help them prove their academic credentials.
4. Cardano and its many-headed Hydra
It's difficult to talk about crypto without getting technical very quickly. Cardano uses a layered blockchain to track transactions and store information. Blockchain ledgers are like very sophisticated databases built using interconnected blocks.
Cardano's layers mean it's able to process transactions faster than many other cryptocurrencies. In fact, it will be faster than Visa's processing capabilities of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).
Cardano has a second layer called Hydra that sits on top of the existing blockchain. It's a bit like the express checkout at the grocery store. The basic blockchain handles the people coming in to do their huge monthly shop, while Hydra handles the quick shops of 10 items or fewer.
Each express checkout till is like a processing pool that's called a Hydra head. Each head can process up to 1,000 TPS. So 1,000 Hydra heads would be able to process 1 million TPS.
Unlike the mythological monster, when you shut down one head, it doesn't spawn two more. However, each user who connects to the network will generate 10 heads. So the more people using the network, the more processing power it has.
5. Cardano has been in the top ten cryptos since it launched
Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who also co-founded Ethereumbut left after a disagreement on how it should be run.
From the outset, Hoskinson (who is something of a crypto superstar) was determined to do things differently. Each step of the platform's development has been peer-reviewed as the experts built this new blockchain from scratch.
That's why ADA has been in the top 10 coins by market capitalization since it launched in 2015.
Is Cardano a good investment?
Before you log on to your cryptocurrency exchangeand spend all your money on Cardano, bear in mind that it still has a long way to go.
For example, Ethereum already has smart contractsup and running, while Cardano hopes to launch them later this year.
Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that let users set conditions on payments. For example, I'll pay you 5 ADA if you give me a copy of your e-book. They are at the heart of many blockchain applications, which is why around 2,800 applications already use Ethereum's network. According to State of the DApps, that's about 80% of the app market.
It's early days for all cryptocurrencies, and for investors, it can be difficult to separate hype from substance. Cardano took the slow and steady approach, which means it has a very solid platform but missed the first-mover advantage. It hopes to roll out smart contract capability later this year, and that will be an important test of its technology. Watch this space closely.",2021-06-01,0.9972,0.112,0.028,0.86

"Ethereum
: $840 billion
Wrapped Ethereum (wETH): $635 billion (Note: wETH is an ERC-20 token of equivalent value to Ethereum commonly used on DeFi platforms.)
: $623 billion
Together, these four major categories currently make up most of the digital currency transaction volume.
The data indicates that Bitcoin is mainly held as a long-term investment, Chainalysis reveals while noting that it has taken a detailed look into the types of wallets holding BTC compared to crypto wallets holding other types of assets.
The blockchain analysis firm was able to separate digital asset wallets into the following categories:
Investors, which they define as self-hosted wallets that have held 75% or more of all cryptocurrency value theyve ever received
Traders, which they define as self-hosted wallets that have held less than 75% of all cryptocurrency value ever received
Services, which are simply wallets hosted by services such as exchanges
As noted in the report:
73% of Bitcoin is held by investors, versus just 58% for Ethereum and 43% for the popular stablecoin USDT_ETH, which is an ERC-20 token version of Tether. Meanwhile, just 7% of all Bitcoin is held by traders, who tend to seek shorter-term gains by trading between a wider variety of assets, versus 18% for Ethereum and 14% for USDT_ETH.
The report also mentioned that Bitcoins use-case as a long-term investment becomes even clearer when we dig more into average age of each coin, meaning the amount of time its been in its current wallet. According to Chainalysis findings, the data is quite striking.
The firm reveals that the average Bitcoin held in a self-hosted wallet was acquired roughly 150 weeks ago, versus 75 weeks for Ethereum and six to seven weeks for popular stablecoins Tether and USDC. In other words, cryptocurrency users hold Bitcoin for roughly twice as long as they do Ethereum and more than 20x longer than they do stablecoins.
Chainalysis also asks who exactly are these long-term Bitcoin investors? The blockchain firm notes that they characterize institutional transfers as transfers above $1 million USD, professional transfers as transfers between $10,000 and $1 million, large retail transfers as transfers between $1,000 and $10,000, and small retail transfers as transfers below $1,000.
The data reveals that institutional investors likely accounted for 69% of all Bitcoin transaction volume during the time period studied, based on the sizes of the individual transactions. When taken together, the data largely fits the narrative weve heard over the last year: Investors, especially those from mainstream financial institutions, have embraced Bitcoin as a long-term investment, with many positioning the asset as a hedge against inflation and other worrisome economic trends, the report revealed. It also pointed out that this is why they are seeing such a high percentage of Bitcoin being held for long periods of time compared to other cryptocurrencies, and so much held by investors whose large transaction sizes suggest theyre at the professional or institutional level.
Chainalysis further noted that as a reminder, despite its lower market cap and less frequent media coverage, Ethereum had more transaction volume than Bitcoin in Q1 2021.
Chanalysis reveals:
If we were to combine Ethereums transaction volume with that of wETH, its ERC-20 token equivalent, Ethereum would have by far the highest transaction volume of any cryptocurrency.
The company also mentioned that since January 2020, the majority of Ethereum transactions have involved at least one DeFi platform, with the majority of these occurring between two DeFi platforms.
As explained in the report:
DeFi platforms are cryptocurrency services built on top of smart contract-enriched blockchains. Once built, they can run autonomously, executing specific financial functions  trades, loans, or other transactions  automatically when specific conditions are met as defined by the underlying code. Because of this, DeFi platforms can exist independently of a company or other governing body.
Importantly, almost all decentralized finance platforms are developed on the Ethereum blockchain  which clearly means they mainly accept Ethereum, along with ERC-20 tokens.
ERC-20 tokens are unique virtual currencies also developed via the Ethereum blockchain, meaning these tokens may be transferred and received from an Ethereum wallet. Many ERC-20 tokens are developed specifically to mirror the price of existing assets, Chainalysis explained.
For example, wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is an ERC-20 token that matches Bitcoins price, while wETH fulfills the same function for Ethereum. USDT_ETH and USDC_ETH match the price of the stablecoins Tether and USDC respectively, which in turn are pegged to the U.S. dollar, the report noted.
Chainalysis also mentioned in its report that DeFis growth is a relatively recent development. In June of last year,  DeFi platforms collectively were receiving between $2 and $3 billion in total weekly value. That figure began to grow quickly in August, and now consistently stands above $20 billion per week as of May 2021, at times spiking above $60 billion, Chainalysis added.
The report pointed out that since the beginning of last year, DeFi has been the fastest growing service category by far, nearly all driven by Ethereum and in that way, Ethereum is playing a key role in crypto innovation, as DeFi is the site of development for several new types of financial services and instruments, including NFTs, decentralized exchanges, and automated loan platforms.
The report continued:
DeFi has also given cryptocurrency a way to tap into community to launch new platforms. Founders of traditional, centralized exchanges and other services would typically have to raise capital themselves to build a new platform and provide it with its initial liquidity. With DeFi, founders can instead borrow funds from users or other backers, who in return get unique tokens associated with the platform that entitle them to a share of the platforms fees. We expect to see more innovation in DeFi over the coming years, most of which will likely be powered by Ethereum.
The report also mentioned that stablecoins are cryptos that are pegged to the price of existing non-crypto assets. The two most popular stablecoins, Tether and U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC), have been pegged to the US dollar, which still serves as the global reserve currency.
The report further noted that stablecoins have a higher collective transaction volume than both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
As mentionedin the report:
The data shows that the majority of Tether moves between exchanges  especially crypto-to-crypto (C2C) exchanges, meaning those that only allow users to exchange cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies, and not for fiat currency. This reflects the crucial role that stablecoins play in trade settlement on exchanges, and especially C2C exchanges. Thanks to their, well, stability, stablecoins allow t",2021-07-03,0.9955,0.068,0.002,0.93
"$150 million (CoinMarketCap, June 2021)
Availability:
Several major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken.
Industry support:
Keep Network says it has partnerships with over 40 organizations, including aggregators, exchanges, and custody providers. Financially, it is backed by some big names, such as Draper Associates and Paradigm.
Understanding Keep Network
It can be hard to define a cryptocurrency especially when you first invest in crypto. Cryptocurrencies are not the same as stocksbecause you don't own a part of the company. But by the same logic, they aren't the same as a traditional currency like a dollar.
KEEP is a governance token. When you buy a governance token, you can have a say in how that cryptocurrency is run. Indeed, Keep Network incentivizes owners to participate and stake their tokens to form nodes.
Nodes are network points that keep the network secure and can store the individual encrypted keeps. You can stake your KEEP to earn rewards and participate in increasing blockchain privacy.
Here are some other things to be aware of.
Tokenized Bitcoin:
Keep Network's first major project and use case is tBTC, a tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC)that can be used on the Ethereum network and applications. Many applications have been built on the Ethereum network, and tBTC enables Bitcoin holders to get involved without selling their coins. Each tBTC is backed by a BTC. The token launched in September 2020 and an improved version 2 is in the pipeline.
Security:
Keep Network carried out three independent security audits to ensure tBTC is secure. It is insured. It also encourages ethical hackers to uncover weaknesses through its bug bounty program.
Competition:
KEEP is not the only token that's trying to bring more privacy to blockchain. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were both designed with privacy in mind, and Cardano (ADA)and Internet Computer (ICP) both offer solutions to the question of digital identity.
Merger with NuCypher:
Keep Network recently announced it would merge its protocols with an encryption cryptocurrency called NuCypher (NU). The new project will be called Keanu. The companies themselves will remain separate. Both sides believe that joining forces at this stage will allow them to become greater than the sum of their parts. Both networks will keep their own digital currencies, so KEEP tokens will not be directly affected.
Should you buy it?
If you're considering buying the KEEP token, there are a lot of ideas to digest. For example, while you don't need to understand the technology, it would be good to have an understanding of the importance of privacy and how the space may unfold.
All cryptocurrencies are risky investments, but newer currencies are riskier. You might be able to get in early and support a hugely successful project, but you might also put your money into one of the many cryptocurrencies that fail. The technology behind KEEP is relatively new and untested, so there's always a risk things could go wrong.
You'll also need to come to grips with the merger with NuCypher in more detail. The idea is that NuCypher will benefit from Keep Network's tokenized Bitcoin while Keep will benefit from NuCypher's bigger network. But it's important you know and are comfortable with what's ahead.

"Twitters Jack Dorsey rejects Ethereum, endorses meme token HamsterCoin
By
-
July 3, 2021
Despite the calls for him to explore other viable investments besides bitcoin, Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey continues to reject ethereum.
Also, this comes despite the fact that Dorseys social media platform has already released 140 NFTs on the Ethereum platform.
Following this news, a Twitter user said it would only be a matter of time before the CEO put some investment in ether. However, Dorsey, being a Bitcoin maximalist saying the asset is the most important thing to happen in his lifetime, replied Noto the user.
Not even the fact that ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by popularity and market capitalization, the Twitter top honcho still doesnt believe it is worth putting money in. In fact, the billionaire is going as far as picking a meme coin over ETH as a show of his rejection.
HamsterCoin over ethereum
In responding to a Twitter post concerning dogecoin, Jack Dorsey inadvertently endorsed and promoted another meme token in HamsterCoin.
The message supposedly claimed that dogecoin is the biggest threat to ethereum. Dorsey replied to this message and said HamsterCoin is a bigger threat to the leading altcoin.
Following this exchange, the price of HamsterCoin jumped by 250% in just a matter of hours  a development reminiscent of the effect Elon Musk had with dogecoin.
Just another useless coin
Built on the Binance Smart Chain, HamsterCoinis a meme token that has no unique use case. Moreover, there is no groundbreaking technology behind the new asset.
It doesnt support smart contracts and there is no security of decentralization, unlike with ethereum. The digital coin, however, promises financial freedom to its users.",2021-07-03,0.2679,0.113,0.097,0.79

By using this wallet, you can connect the web page and the Ethereum protocol (blockchain).By connecting, you can send and receive Ether and ERC20 tokens from your browser.
However, since the private key is managed online, it is not recommended to store a large amount of Ether or ERC20 tokens. If you want to store it strictly, use a hardware wallet or the like.

According to CryptoCompare, Poa Network is a public sidechain based on the Ethereum protocol. The blockchain will feature the Proof-of-Authority algorithm, which does not depend on the nodes solving mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of authorities, pre-selected validators that will be able to seal the blocks and secure the network. The validators identity will be public enabling any third party to check their identity. The Poa Network will allow organizations to build their own networks with their own validators and developers to deploy DApps. On April 28, 2018, the POA Team announced the launch of a cross-chain bridge that gives users the ability to send POA tokens back and forth between the POA Network and the Ethereum network. POA Bridge went live on May 10. The POA to Ethereum transfer will result in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user will also have the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network.

Ethereum Profile
Ethereum (ETH)
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. It launched on July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 116,560,649 coins.

According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

Big Four auditing firm Ernst & Young (EY) has contributed a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) layer-2 protocol into the public domain in order to help with addressing rising transaction costs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain network, the worlds largest smart contract platform.
The protocol has been designed to enable private transfers of Ethereum tokens. It improves overall efficiency while offering a developer-friendly environment. The new solutions from EYintegrate rollup technologies in order to carry out transfers at an affordable price.
EYs management noted in an update, earlier this week, that theyve released a new set of tools for privately managing transactions conducted on the Ethereumblockchain. The initiative, called Nightfall 3, combines zero-knowledge proofs (ZK or ZKP) with a new model for processing transaction verification. This is done to increase efficiency while lowering transaction costs (known as an optimistic rollup). The combined protocol is referred to as a ZK-Optimistic Rollup.
As explainedin a blog post by EY, Nightfall 3 aggregates ZKP transactions into groups, called rollups. These are called optimistic rollups because the system assumes the transactions to be valid unless proven otherwise and eliminates the process of having all participants verify all transactions, the auditing firm explained.
The company added:
To ensure that only correctly-formed layer 2 blocks are incorporated into the final blockchain record, users are economically incentivized to challenge incorrect blocks. When a challenge is made, the smart contract arbitrates the accuracy of the challenge, rewarding correct challenges and removing the incorrect layer 2 block.
The firm also noted that EY teams have previously contributed ZKP protocols to the public domain, (named Nightfall). Since the initial contribution in 2019, the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) services has caused network congestion and raised transaction costs, known as gas fees, on the Ethereum blockchain, the update noted.
This new protocol represents a significant improvement in transaction efficiency and is expected to more than offset recent increases in gas fees, the announcement revealed.
Paul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, stated:
Based on EY experience, ZK-Optimistic roll-ups are currently among the most effective in balancing security incentives and mathematical efficiency for running private transactions on the public Ethereum network. As we have in the past, we are again contributing this code into the public domain to speed up enterprise adoption of this technology.
By using ZK-Optimistic Rollups, Nightfall 3 is able to achieve a cost of around 8,200 gas per transaction, while also maintaining privacy. This is nearly one-eighth of the cost required to to make a conventional, public ERC20 token transfer, the update noted.
The announcement also mentioned that Nightfall 3 has been designed to reduce the learning curve required by developers to implement privacy by giving developers a standardized application programming interface (API) that appears similar to other token transfer tools.
Dr. Duncan Westland, Associate Director, Head of Global Blockchain Research and Development, Ernst & Young LLP, remarked:
When developing a new ZKP protocol, developers need to be able to interact directly with low level ZKP constructs. If the user only requires private token transfers, its possible to have the application manage the ZKP interactions. In that case, provided the user is careful about how Layer 1 to Layer 2 transfers are made, a ZKP transaction can be considered a conventional token exchange, albeit with added privacy. Having an API that allows users to work that way can speed up development.
EY teams have made the prototype code for Nightfall 3 available in the public domain, releasing all ownership rights to simplify access by others. It can be found here

"(MENAFN
-  Daily Forex) The difference between success and failure in Forex trading is very likely to depend mostly upon which currency pairs you choose to trade each week and in which direction, and not on the exact trading methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits.
When starting the trading week, it is a good idea to look at the big picture of what is developing in the market as a whole and how such developments and affected by macro fundamentals and market sentiment.
There are a few strong, long-term trends left in the market: U.S. stock markets and WTI Crude Oil are reaching long-term highs.

Big Picture 4th July 2021
Last weeks Forex market saw the strongest rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the strongest fall in the relative value of the Australian dollar, although the values were so small as to be almost negligible.
I wrote in my previous piece last week that the best trades were likely to be as being long of the S & P 500 Index and WTI Crude Oil, and short of Ethereum targeting $1,405. Unfortunately, Ethereum rose by 8.61% over the week, although the S & P 500 Index rose by 1.57% and WTI Crude Oil rose by 1.53%. This produced an averaged loss of 1.84% although without the crypto element, it was an average win of 1.55%.
Fundamental Analysis  &  Market Sentiment
The headline takeaway from last week was that the era of unlimited central bank stimulus seems to be beginning to come to an end, as inflation expectations are generally rising. However economic growth and employment continue to be generally exceeding expectations, pushing U.S. stock markets and crude oil to all-time or long-term highs  , while in the Forex market, the U.S. dollar continues to gain, albeit at a slower pace.
U.S. non-farm payrolls data exceeded expectations somewhat, with 850k new jobs created  last month compared to the expected total of 725k. However, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 5.9% when it had been expected to fall to 5.6%.
The other key data point from last week is the  better-than-expected Canadian month on month GDP data, which saw a decline of only 0.3%  when it had been expected to decline by 0.8%.
Last week saw the global number of confirmed new coronavirus cases and deaths rise for the second consecutive week after falling for two months, suggesting that the spread of the more highly infectious Delta (Indian) variant is beginning to have an impact on global numbers even though approximately 23.8% of the global population has received at least one vaccination.
Excepting extremely small nations, the fastest progress towards herd immunity has taken place in Iceland, Kuwait, Canada, Israel, Bhutan, Mongolia, Belgium, the U.K. and Chile, which have each inoculated more than 63% of their respective populations. Immunization is now proceeding more quickly in the European Union than it is in the U.S. although the U.S. is ahead of the E.U. with 54% of its population having received at least one shot of a vaccine, while the E.U. has vaccinated 42% of its population. A few nations have begun vaccinating older children, but this is mostly being done on only a limited basis.
The strongest growth in new confirmed coronavirus cases right now is happening in Algeria, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Cuba, Cyprus, Fiji, Finland, Greece, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico,  Panama, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and the U.K. The U.K.s case seems unusual as it has such a high vaccination rate, although the under-30s within Britains ageing population are still mostly unvaccinated.
Technical AnalysisU.S. Dollar Index
The weekly price chart below shows the U.S. Dollar index printed a bullish candlestick last week. However, it should be noted that the price action was unable to break the nearby resistance levels  , and that the candle closed within the bottom half of its range. The Index is above its levels from both three and six months ago which shows  a long-term bullish trend is in force  . Overall  , next weeks price movement in the U.S. Dollar still looks more likely to be upwards than downwards, provided that the support level at 11833 continues to hold up. This suggests that trades long of the USD against other currencies are most likely to be appropriate over this coming week, but the longer the key resistance levels marked in red hold the price down, the less likely we will be to see a further substantial rise soon.
S & P 500 Index
The S & P 500 Index printed a strong bullish candlestick which closed right at the top of its weekly range at an all-time high price. These are simply very bullish signs  which indicate a further rise next week is more likely than not to happen. Since the coronavirus crash of 2020, this major U.S. equity index has almost doubled, which is an excellent return over barely fifteen months.  The S & P 500 Index remains a buy.
WTI Crude Oil
WTI Crude Oil printed a strong, good-sized bullish candlestick last week which closed within the upper third of its price range, again making a new 2.5-year high price.  These are simply very bullish signs  which indicate a further rise next week is more likely than not to happen.  WTI Crude Oil remains a buy but due to high swap fees traders may prefer not to hold this instrument overnight.
USD/JPY
The USD/JPY currency pair made its highest weekly close in over a year but sold off quite strongly on Friday after peaking just after the London open that day.  There is clearly a valid, long-term bullish trend here, with the USD unquestionably the strongest major currency in the Forex market. However, the trend recently has been prone to repeated deep pullbacks which have made trading it profitably somewhat challenging. I see the best approach here as waiting for new highs (above 111.51) at the daily (New York) close before entering any long trade.
Bottom Line
I see the best likely opportunities in the financial markets this week

"Ethereum still a no for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey
By
-
July 4, 2021
Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive officer, has been receiving advice and requests to consider leveraging other cryptocurrencies like ethereum. But the widely-known
Bitcoin
advocate is still firm with his decision to remain loyal to the worlds most dominant crypto coin.
Many analysts and crypto fanatics have been suspecting that Dorsey is preparing to make a big investment in ethereum since Twitter has already released 140 NFTs on the Ethereum platform.
What is the biggest threat to bitcoin?
Almost everybody considers ethereum as bitcoins biggest threat and the only crypto coin that can unseat bitcoin from its current dominant position.
But Dorsey has a completely different opinion about this matter, in his latest tweet, he said that if there is anything that can give bitcoin a massive threat, it would be the HamsterCoin. HamsterCoin is a meme coin (just like dogecoin) that flows in high volumes in the market.
After the CEOs tweet, the price of
HamsterCoin
surged by an astounding 250% in just a matter of hours. And while its impressive that a single tweet can drive up a cryptocurrencys price, its not really new as Tesla big boss Elon Musk has done it before, a lot of times.
HamsterCoins charm
By taking a closer look, theres nothing special about HamsterCoin. Unlike other coins, it is not integrated with any advanced technology, doesnt support smart contracts, and its not decentralized.
All the coin can promise is financial freedom for everyone who would be brave enough to purchase it. But even with HamsterCoins unattractiveness when it comes to the lack of impressive features, investors have snapped up large volumes of the coin that helped increased the meme coins value.

"Ethereum will likely rise on the hype and speculation surrounding the London upgrade event.
Eventually, the development team behind the cryptocurrency hope to resolve its flaws and create Ethereum 2.0.
This new version of Ethereum will be more scalable, secure and sustainable than the original cryptocurrency.
The creation of Ethereum 2.0 is going to be incremental, and the London Hard Fork upgrade is one of the stepping stones in renewing the Ethereum blockchain and protocol.
Ethereum has surged nearly 30 percent in one week
(Image: GETTY)
Ethereum will eventually upgrade to the less energy-intensive Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.
In the world of cryptocurrencies, control of the blockchain is proportional to the number of economic resources that have been invested in the network.
In Proof of Stake, which Ethereum is upgrading to, these resources involve staking amounts of Ethereum.
In Proof of Work, which bitcoin and Ethereum both currently rely upon to verify transactions, this control is based on how much processing power a miner can bring to the network.

The price of bitcoin has also risen

Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.
Founder Mr Buterin expected Ethereum 2.0 to be fully in place by the end of 2021.
This move could transform Ethereum into one of the most environmentally friendly of its kind.
Financial institutions are studying the rise of Ethereum carefully as it is the hallmark coin of the decentralised finance (DeFi) movement.

"$150 million (CoinMarketCap, June 2021)
Availability:
Several major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken.
Industry support:
Keep Network says it has partnerships with over 40 organizations, including aggregators, exchanges, and custody providers. Financially, it is backed by some big names, such as Draper Associates and Paradigm.
Understanding Keep Network
It can be hard to define a cryptocurrency especially when you first invest in crypto. Cryptocurrencies are not the same as stocksbecause you don't own a part of the company. But by the same logic, they aren't the same as a traditional currency like a dollar.
KEEP is a governance token. When you buy a governance token, you can have a say in how that cryptocurrency is run. Indeed, Keep Network incentivizes owners to participate and stake their tokens to form nodes.
Nodes are network points that keep the network secure and can store the individual encrypted keeps. You can stake your KEEP to earn rewards and participate in increasing blockchain privacy.
Here are some other things to be aware of.
Tokenized Bitcoin:
Keep Network's first major project and use case is tBTC, a tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC)that can be used on the Ethereum network and applications. Many applications have been built on the Ethereum network, and tBTC enables Bitcoin holders to get involved without selling their coins. Each tBTC is backed by a BTC. The token launched in September 2020 and an improved version 2 is in the pipeline.
Security:
Keep Network carried out three independent security audits to ensure tBTC is secure. It is insured. It also encourages ethical hackers to uncover weaknesses through its bug bounty program.
Competition:
KEEP is not the only token that's trying to bring more privacy to blockchain. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were both designed with privacy in mind, and Cardano (ADA)and Internet Computer (ICP) both offer solutions to the question of digital identity.
Merger with NuCypher:
Keep Network recently announced it would merge its protocols with an encryption cryptocurrency called NuCypher (NU). The new project will be called Keanu. The companies themselves will remain separate. Both sides believe that joining forces at this stage will allow them to become greater than the sum of their parts. Both networks will keep their own digital currencies, so KEEP tokens will not be directly affected.
Should you buy it?
If you're considering buying the KEEP token, there are a lot of ideas to digest. For example, while you don't need to understand the technology, it would be good to have an understanding of the importance of privacy and how the space may unfold.
All cryptocurrencies are risky investments, but newer currencies are riskier. You might be able to get in early and support a hugely successful project, but you might also put your money into one of the many cryptocurrencies that fail. The technology behind KEEP is relatively new and untested, so there's always a risk things could go wrong.
You'll also need to come to grips with the merger with NuCypher in more detail. The idea is that NuCypher will benefit from Keep Network's tokenized Bitcoin while Keep will benefit from NuCypher's bigger network. But it's important you know and are comfortable with what's ahead.
Buy and sell crypto on an expert picked exchange
There are hundreds of platforms around the world that are waiting to give you access to thousands of cryptocurrencies. And to find the one that's right for you, you'll need to decide what features that matter most to you.

Cryptocurrencies will democratise finance the way Internet did for information
Cryptocurrency has the power to create a borderless world of finance that is not controlled by any individual or entity, but by a community. Every country has its own banking rules and regulations and financial institutions are bound by geography. But cryptocurrency would help break this barrier in the future. While the Internet allows for the transfer of information, blockchain enables the transfer of value without the need for any intermediaries. It has the power to revolutionise the financial industry by providing solutions for faster, transparent, and secure cross-border transaction of data via blockchain technology. See more here

Ripples XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.6910 and the second major resistance level at $0.7091.
A bearish to end the day saw Ripples XRP fall back through the second major resistance level to end the day at sub-$0.70 levels.
At the time of writing, Ripples XRP was down by 0.76% to 0.69057. A bearish start to the day saw Ripples XRP fall from an early morning high $0.69548 to a low $0.68964.
Ripples XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
For the day ahead
Ripples XRP will need to avoid a fall back through the $0.6904 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $0.7149 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripples XRP to break out from Sundays high $0.70946.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.
In the event of another breakout, Ripples XRP could test resistance at $0.75 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $0.7340.
A fall back through the $0.6904 pivot would bring the first major support level at $0.6714 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ripples XRP should steer clear of the second major support level at $0.6469.
Looking at the Technical Indicators
First Major Support Level: $0.6714
Pivot Level: $0.6904
First Major resistance Level: $0.7149

According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

Big Four auditing firm Ernst & Young (EY) has contributed a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) layer-2 protocol into the public domain in order to help with addressing rising transaction costs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain network, the worlds largest smart contract platform.
The protocol has been designed to enable private transfers of Ethereum tokens. It improves overall efficiency while offering a developer-friendly environment. The new solutions from EYintegrate rollup technologies in order to carry out transfers at an affordable price.
EYs management noted in an update, earlier this week, that theyve released a new set of tools for privately managing transactions conducted on the Ethereumblockchain. The initiative, called Nightfall 3, combines zero-knowledge proofs (ZK or ZKP) with a new model for processing transaction verification. This is done to increase efficiency while lowering transaction costs (known as an optimistic rollup). The combined protocol is referred to as a ZK-Optimistic Rollup.
As explainedin a blog post by EY, Nightfall 3 aggregates ZKP transactions into groups, called rollups. These are called optimistic rollups because the system assumes the transactions to be valid unless proven otherwise and eliminates the process of having all participants verify all transactions, the auditing firm explained.
The company added:
To ensure that only correctly-formed layer 2 blocks are incorporated into the final blockchain record, users are economically incentivized to challenge incorrect blocks. When a challenge is made, the smart contract arbitrates the accuracy of the challenge, rewarding correct challenges and removing the incorrect layer 2 block.
The firm also noted that EY teams have previously contributed ZKP protocols to the public domain, (named Nightfall). Since the initial contribution in 2019, the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) services has caused network congestion and raised transaction costs, known as gas fees, on the Ethereum blockchain, the update noted.
This new protocol represents a significant improvement in transaction efficiency and is expected to more than offset recent increases in gas fees, the announcement revealed.
Paul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, stated:
Based on EY experience, ZK-Optimistic roll-ups are currently among the most effective in balancing security incentives and mathematical efficiency for running private transactions on the public Ethereum network. As we have in the past, we are again contributing this code into the public domain to speed up enterprise adoption of this technology.
By using ZK-Optimistic Rollups, Nightfall 3 is able to achieve a cost of around 8,200 gas per transaction, while also maintaining privacy. This is nearly one-eighth of the cost required to to make a conventional, public ERC20 token transfer, the update noted.
The announcement also mentioned that Nightfall 3 has been designed to reduce the learning curve required by developers to implement privacy by giving developers a standardized application programming interface (API) that appears similar to other token transfer tools.
Dr. Duncan Westland, Associate Director, Head of Global Blockchain Research and Development, Ernst & Young LLP, remarked:
When developing a new ZKP protocol, developers need to be able to interact directly with low level ZKP constructs. If the user only requires private token transfers, its possible to have the application manage the ZKP interactions. In that case, provided the user is careful about how Layer 1 to Layer 2 transfers are made, a ZKP transaction can be considered a conventional token exchange, albeit with added privacy. Having an API that allows users to work that way can speed up development.
EY teams have made the prototype code for Nightfall 3 available in the public domain, releasing all ownership rights to simplify access by others. It can be found here

"(MENAFN
-  Daily Forex) The difference between success and failure in Forex trading is very likely to depend mostly upon which currency pairs you choose to trade each week and in which direction, and not on the exact trading methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits.
When starting the trading week, it is a good idea to look at the big picture of what is developing in the market as a whole and how such developments and affected by macro fundamentals and market sentiment.
There are a few strong, long-term trends left in the market: U.S. stock markets and WTI Crude Oil are reaching long-term highs.
Advertisement  Take advantage of today's Crude Oil movements Trade Now
Big Picture 4th July 2021
Last weeks Forex market saw the strongest rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the strongest fall in the relative value of the Australian dollar, although the values were so small as to be almost negligible.
I wrote in my previous piece last week that the best trades were likely to be as being long of the S & P 500 Index and WTI Crude Oil, and short of Ethereum targeting $1,405. Unfortunately, Ethereum rose by 8.61% over the week, although the S & P 500 Index rose by 1.57% and WTI Crude Oil rose by 1.53%. This produced an averaged loss of 1.84% although without the crypto element, it was an average win of 1.55%.
Fundamental Analysis  &  Market Sentiment
The headline takeaway from last week was that the era of unlimited central bank stimulus seems to be beginning to come to an end, as inflation expectations are generally rising. However economic growth and employment continue to be generally exceeding expectations, pushing U.S. stock markets and crude oil to all-time or long-term highs  , while in the Forex market, the U.S. dollar continues to gain, albeit at a slower pace.
U.S. non-farm payrolls data exceeded expectations somewhat, with 850k new jobs created  last month compared to the expected total of 725k. However, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 5.9% when it had been expected to fall to 5.6%.
The other key data point from last week is the  better-than-expected Canadian month on month GDP data, which saw a decline of only 0.3%  when it had been expected to decline by 0.8%.
Last week saw the global number of confirmed new coronavirus cases and deaths rise for the second consecutive week after falling for two months, suggesting that the spread of the more highly infectious Delta (Indian) variant is beginning to have an impact on global numbers even though approximately 23.8% of the global population has received at least one vaccination.
Excepting extremely small nations, the fastest progress towards herd immunity has taken place in Iceland, Kuwait, Canada, Israel, Bhutan, Mongolia, Belgium, the U.K. and Chile, which have each inoculated more than 63% of their respective populations. Immunization is now proceeding more quickly in the European Union than it is in the U.S. although the U.S. is ahead of the E.U. with 54% of its population having received at least one shot of a vaccine, while the E.U. has vaccinated 42% of its population. A few nations have begun vaccinating older children, but this is mostly being done on only a limited basis.
The strongest growth in new confirmed coronavirus cases right now is happening in Algeria, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Cuba, Cyprus, Fiji, Finland, Greece, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico,  Panama, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and the U.K. The U.K.s case seems unusual as it has such a high vaccination rate, although the under-30s within Britains ageing population are still mostly unvaccinated.
Technical AnalysisU.S. Dollar Index
The weekly price chart below shows the U.S. Dollar index printed a bullish candlestick last week. However, it should be noted that the price action was unable to break the nearby resistance levels  , and that the candle closed within the bottom half of its range. The Index is above its levels from both three and six months ago which shows  a long-term bullish trend is in force  . Overall  , next weeks price movement in the U.S. Dollar still looks more likely to be upwards than downwards, provided that the support level at 11833 continues to hold up. This suggests that trades long of the USD against other currencies are most likely to be appropriate over this coming week, but the longer the key resistance levels marked in red hold the price down, the less likely we will be to see a further substantial rise soon.
S & P 500 Index
The S & P 500 Index printed a strong bullish candlestick which closed right at the top of its weekly range at an all-time high price. These are simply very bullish signs  which indicate a further rise next week is more likely than not to happen. Since the coronavirus crash of 2020, this major U.S. equity index has almost doubled, which is an excellent return over barely fifteen months.  The S & P 500 Index remains a buy.
WTI Crude Oil
WTI Crude Oil printed a strong, good-sized bullish candlestick last week which closed within the upper third of its price range, again making a new 2.5-year high price.  These are simply very bullish signs  which indicate a further rise next week is more likely than not to happen.  WTI Crude Oil remains a buy but due to high swap fees traders may prefer not to hold this instrument overnight.
USD/JPY
The USD/JPY currency pair made its highest weekly close in over a year but sold off quite strongly on Friday after peaking just after the London open that day.  There is clearly a valid, long-term bullish trend here, with the USD unquestionably the strongest major currency in the Forex market. However, the trend recently has been prone to repeated deep pullbacks which have made trading it profitably somewhat challenging. I see the best approach here as waiting for new highs (above 111.51) at the daily (New York) close before entering any long trade.
Bottom Line
I see the best likely opportunities in the financial markets this week

"Ethereum still a no for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey
By
-
July 4, 2021
Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive officer, has been receiving advice and requests to consider leveraging other cryptocurrencies like ethereum. But the widely-known
Bitcoin
advocate is still firm with his decision to remain loyal to the worlds most dominant crypto coin.
Many analysts and crypto fanatics have been suspecting that Dorsey is preparing to make a big investment in ethereum since Twitter has already released 140 NFTs on the Ethereum platform.
What is the biggest threat to bitcoin?
Almost everybody considers ethereum as bitcoins biggest threat and the only crypto coin that can unseat bitcoin from its current dominant position.
But Dorsey has a completely different opinion about this matter, in his latest tweet, he said that if there is anything that can give bitcoin a massive threat, it would be the HamsterCoin. HamsterCoin is a meme coin (just like dogecoin) that flows in high volumes in the market.
After the CEOs tweet, the price of
HamsterCoin
surged by an astounding 250% in just a matter of hours. And while its impressive that a single tweet can drive up a cryptocurrencys price, its not really new as Tesla big boss Elon Musk has done it before, a lot of times.
HamsterCoins charm
By taking a closer look, theres nothing special about HamsterCoin. Unlike other coins, it is not integrated with any advanced technology, doesnt support smart contracts, and its not decentralized.
All the coin can promise is financial freedom for everyone who would be brave enough to purchase it. But even with HamsterCoins unattractiveness when it comes to the lack of impressive features, investors have snapped up large volumes of the coin that helped increased the meme coins value.

"Ethereum will likely rise on the hype and speculation surrounding the London upgrade event.
Eventually, the development team behind the cryptocurrency hope to resolve its flaws and create Ethereum 2.0.
This new version of Ethereum will be more scalable, secure and sustainable than the original cryptocurrency.
The creation of Ethereum 2.0 is going to be incremental, and the London Hard Fork upgrade is one of the stepping stones in renewing the Ethereum blockchain and protocol.
Ethereum has surged nearly 30 percent in one week
(Image: GETTY)
Ethereum will eventually upgrade to the less energy-intensive Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.
In the world of cryptocurrencies, control of the blockchain is proportional to the number of economic resources that have been invested in the network.
In Proof of Stake, which Ethereum is upgrading to, these resources involve staking amounts of Ethereum.
In Proof of Work, which bitcoin and Ethereum both currently rely upon to verify transactions, this control is based on how much processing power a miner can bring to the network.

The price of bitcoin has also risen

Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.
Founder Mr Buterin expected Ethereum 2.0 to be fully in place by the end of 2021.
This move could transform Ethereum into one of the most environmentally friendly of its kind.
Financial institutions are studying the rise of Ethereum carefully as it is the hallmark coin of the decentralised finance (DeFi) movement.

"$150 million (CoinMarketCap, June 2021)
Availability:
Several major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken.
Industry support:
Keep Network says it has partnerships with over 40 organizations, including aggregators, exchanges, and custody providers. Financially, it is backed by some big names, such as Draper Associates and Paradigm.
Understanding Keep Network
It can be hard to define a cryptocurrency especially when you first invest in crypto. Cryptocurrencies are not the same as stocksbecause you don't own a part of the company. But by the same logic, they aren't the same as a traditional currency like a dollar.
KEEP is a governance token. When you buy a governance token, you can have a say in how that cryptocurrency is run. Indeed, Keep Network incentivizes owners to participate and stake their tokens to form nodes.
Nodes are network points that keep the network secure and can store the individual encrypted keeps. You can stake your KEEP to earn rewards and participate in increasing blockchain privacy.
Here are some other things to be aware of.
Tokenized Bitcoin:
Keep Network's first major project and use case is tBTC, a tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC)that can be used on the Ethereum network and applications. Many applications have been built on the Ethereum network, and tBTC enables Bitcoin holders to get involved without selling their coins. Each tBTC is backed by a BTC. The token launched in September 2020 and an improved version 2 is in the pipeline.
Security:
Keep Network carried out three independent security audits to ensure tBTC is secure. It is insured. It also encourages ethical hackers to uncover weaknesses through its bug bounty program.
Competition:
KEEP is not the only token that's trying to bring more privacy to blockchain. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were both designed with privacy in mind, and Cardano (ADA)and Internet Computer (ICP) both offer solutions to the question of digital identity.
Merger with NuCypher:
Keep Network recently announced it would merge its protocols with an encryption cryptocurrency called NuCypher (NU). The new project will be called Keanu. The companies themselves will remain separate. Both sides believe that joining forces at this stage will allow them to become greater than the sum of their parts. Both networks will keep their own digital currencies, so KEEP tokens will not be directly affected.
Should you buy it?
If you're considering buying the KEEP token, there are a lot of ideas to digest. For example, while you don't need to understand the technology, it would be good to have an understanding of the importance of privacy and how the space may unfold.
All cryptocurrencies are risky investments, but newer currencies are riskier. You might be able to get in early and support a hugely successful project, but you might also put your money into one of the many cryptocurrencies that fail. The technology behind KEEP is relatively new and untested, so there's always a risk things could go wrong.
You'll also need to come to grips with the merger with NuCypher in more detail. The idea is that NuCypher will benefit from Keep Network's tokenized Bitcoin while Keep will benefit from NuCypher's bigger network. But it's important you know and are comfortable with what's ahead.
Buy and sell crypto on an expert picked exchange
There are hundreds of platforms around the world that are waiting to give you access to thousands of cryptocurrencies. And to find the one that's right for you, you'll need to decide what features that matter most to you.

Cryptocurrencies will democratise finance the way Internet did for information
Cryptocurrency has the power to create a borderless world of finance that is not controlled by any individual or entity, but by a community. Every country has its own banking rules and regulations and financial institutions are bound by geography. But cryptocurrency would help break this barrier in the future. While the Internet allows for the transfer of information, blockchain enables the transfer of value without the need for any intermediaries. It has the power to revolutionise the financial industry by providing solutions for faster, transparent, and secure cross-border transaction of data via blockchain technology. See more here

Layer 1 Blockchain.
In fact, if you think logically, you should understand that if there is 1, it is probably because there are two or more.
Therefore, we will consider the concept of layer 1 Blockchain together with the concept of layer 2.
Layer 1 Blockchain is the term thats used to describe the underlying main blockchain architecture.
Layer 2, is an overlaying network that lies on top of the underlying blockchain.
For Example:
NEM recently announced a partnership with StakeHound. The essence of the partnership is that XEM holders have the opportunity to participate in the DeFi ecosystem of Ethereum. To do this, StakeHound has created a layer - 2solution that allows you to transfer your XEM to the Ethereum blockchain, receiving native ERC20 tokens called StakedXEM in return.
In this example, Ethereum is the layer-1 blockchain, while the StakedXEM is layer-2.",2021-07-05,0.4215,0.046,0.019,0.935

Ethereum Coin Profile
Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)
is a proof-of-work (PoW) coin that uses the Ethash hashing algorithm. Its launch date was July 30th, 2015. Ethereums total supply is 116,571,867 coins. The Reddit community for Ethereum is /r/ethereumand the currencys Github account can be viewed here The official website for Ethereum is www.ethereum.org Ethereums official message board is forum.ethereum.org Ethereums official Twitter account is @ethereumprojectand its Facebook page is accessible here
According to CryptoCompare, Sandwich complexity model: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the middle layers of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users  high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute. Freedom: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of net neutrality. One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for off-label purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in unauthorized ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation). Generalization: protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier  the concept of message is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including function call and event interesting to outside watchers, and it is worth separating the two. Have No Features: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like locktime feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send signed data packets and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid. Non-risk-aversion: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)

Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: ETH discovers momentum, while BTC  and XRP stuck in quicksand
|
7/5/2021 5:29:25 PM GMT
Bitcoin price gains 1.66% for the week but registers the lowest weekly volume since the beginning of April.
Ethereum price logs a 17.05% gain for the week, marking the best week since the beginning of April, but volume evaporates.
XRP price jumps 7.28% for the week, holds crucial $0.65 level, but weekly volume is the lowest since October 2020.
Bitcoin price creates a new line in the sand between $35,000-$35,000 as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) converges. Ethereum price about to collide with the 50-day SMA while trading around the 50% Fibonacciretracement of the March 2020-May 2021 advance at $2,237. XRP price slips into a new trading range between $0.650-$0.740 after triggering a rising wedge patternon July 1.
Bitcoin price questions abound, but answers difficult to find
Two weeks ago, Bitcoin price staged an impressive rebound from the dominant $30,000 level, marking the third time in the previous six weeks. Due to the velocity of the rebound and solid weekly close in the form of a bullish hammer candlestick pattern, it appeared that BTC was communicating a keen interest and robust demand from prominent investors.
Adding to the optimism was the complete Elliot five wave down pattern and the bullish momentum divergence on the daily Relative Strength (RSI), combined with the Mayer Multiple showing that BTC was cheap relative to its long-term trend.
However, Bitcoin price failed to capitalize on the momentum and closed last week with a 1.66% gain, despite triggering the hammer pattern with a trade and daily close above $35,741 on June 29. The weekly volume was the lowest since the beginning of April, showing an absence of a bid and a return to uncertainty.
Since June 22, Bitcoin price has printed higher lows, creating a minor rising trendline while struggling to accumulate traction above $35,000-$35,500, thereby printing mildly higher highs. Overall, the price action has been corrective, with the 50-day SMA now converging, adding downward pressure on BTC and presenting a new technical barrier for the flagship cryptocurrency.
At this point, Bitcoin price needs a daily close above the 50-day SMA at $36,359 and the anchored VWAP from October 21, 2020, at $37,732 before consideration can be given to a new long position.
BTC/USD
daily chart
It is worth reiterating that Bitcoin price did trigger the neckline of a larger head-and-shoulders pattern on June 22. The pattern will remain active until BTC trades above the right shoulder high of $41,332. Moreover, the digital asset did confirm a bearish Death Cross pattern on June 19 when the 50-day SMA crossed below the 200-day SMA.
On June 28, the probabilities were stacked in favor of further upside. Still, this past week has put the burden of proof back on the bulls as BTC lost conviction and momentum, both critical to overcoming the growing resistance at $35,000-$35,500. For now, Bitcoin price is trading like it is quicksand.
Ethereum price positive as the London hard fork comes into focus
The positive response of Ethereum price to the outstanding support framed by the 200-day SMA at $1,878, the 2020 rising trend line at $1,793, the 61.8% retracement of the March 2020-May 2021 advance at $1,730 and the May 23 low of $1,728 created a hint of optimism for enthusiastic ETH investors and short term speculators on June 22.
On June 28, Ethereum price closed above the February high of $2,041, enlisting the first positive step towards higher prices. Since capturing $2,041, ETH closed above the 50% retracement level of the March 2020-May 2021 advance at $2,237 on two occasions and closedlast week with a 17.05% gain.
Todays Ethereum price decline tests the 50% retracement level again as the 50-day SMA rapidly converges with ETH, elaborating a new obstaclefor the international settlement token.
Overall, Ethereum price action has been a bullish divergence from Bitcoin. Still, the underlying issue of conviction manifested through volume also remains a problem. It raises the probability that the improving price structure may be a temporary diversion before a resumption of the ETH weakness.
A daily close above the 50-day SMA at $2,411 and the upper trend line of a new descending triangle around $2,640 would markimportant technical milestones for the bullish narrative.
ETH/USD daily chart
If Ethereum price closes below the 2020 rising trend line at $1,885 and the 61.8% retracement level of the March 2020-May 2021 advance at $1,730, ETH may explore the support established by the 2018 high at $1,419, yielding a 36% decline from the current price.
On a relative basis, Ethereum price stood out last week among the crypto majors. Still, it should not diminish the insistence on seeing volume confirmation and strong closes above dominant resistance levels. Additionally, descending triangle patterns are defined as continuation formations, lifting the probability that Ethereum price could eventually resolve to the downside.
XRP price trendless with no catalyst on the horizon
To review, at the June 22 low XRP price had declined 70% and a remarkable 50% from the June 1 high, liquidating the May 23 low of $0.652, a level fortified by weekly highs in late 2020 and February 2021. Nonetheless, Ripplerealized three important technical milestones that provoked a 45% rebound into June 29: a test of the 78.6% retracement of the December 2020-April 2021 advance at $0.555, an undercut of the 50-week SMA at $0.540 and registered an oversold reading on the daily RSI for the first time since late December 2020.
The 45% rebound was noteworthy, but it lacked the impulsiveness that characterizes meaningful bottoms and the momentum to enable XRP price to conquer the massive resistance around $0.740-$0.760. The result was a rising wedge formation triggering on July 1, quickly putting the support level of $0.650 in play. Ripple has been holding the critical level for the last four days.
The Ripple rising wedge patterns measured move is approximately 30%, suggesting that XRP price will push through the 78.6% retracement level of $0.555 and the June 22 low of $0.512 before bottoming at around the measure move target of $0.477.
It is important to note that XRP price has no visible support below the measured move target, raising the pressure on bullish Ripple speculators.
XRP/USD daily chart
Due to the clarity of the price structure from the June 22 low and the definitive resistance in the range of $0.740-$0.760, Ripple needs a daily close above $0.760 to unravel the dominant bearish narrative.
An emerging scenario that has been discussed in the past is for XRP price to fall into a trading range between $0.555 and $0.760, thereby offering potent trading conditions for swing traders due to the fortified support and resistance levels and the attractive 30-40% profit opportunities that lie between. For long-term investors, Ripple is dead money under $0.760.

Crypto trader and influencer Lark Davis says four catalysts could ignite a major Ethereum rally in the near future.
In a new video, Davis explains why he believes ETH is set to take off, first noting that last month Ethereum had about 200,000 more daily active addresses than Bitcoin. The popular crypto analyst also highlights the slow but steady uptrend in the number of Ethereums daily active addresses.
ADVERTISEMENT
Davis says the surging on-chain activity can be attributed to Ethereum having a large number of use cases relative to other crypto assets.
With Ethereum, theres just so much more you can be doing, right? You can be doing decentralized finance (DeFi), buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or sending stablecoins or whatever else you might want to do on Ethereum.
The analyst also points out that Twitter is now using the Ethereum network to mint NFTs, even though the companys CEO Jack Dorsey has long been known as a Bitcoin maximalist.
This is really, really big. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, famous hardcore Bitcoin maximalist using Ethereum. Twitter has given away 140 free NFTs What this indicates is Twitter is using Ethereum. So in spite of all of the rhetoric from Jack Dorsey about Bitcoin being the best thing in the universe, here is the reality: Twitter still has not bought Bitcoin for their company reserves. But Twitter is using Ethereum.
Another catalyst that may spark a serious Ethereum run, says Davis, is the approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
We do have a new Ethereum ETF application that has come out. [This] could unleash a wave of incredible liquidity into these markets. If the SEC were to approve just one or two Ethereum ETFs this year, that would immediately mean that all these traditional investors and all these big funds who are just never going to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum off the open market are now going to have the ability to easily put a BTC ETF or ETH ETF into their retirement accounts. Thats a big deal.
Finally, Davis notes that nearly six million Ethereum has been staked on the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract, meaning that a huge chunk of the ETH supply is locked up.
Ethereum 2.0 approaching six million staked Ethereum. That is a lot of belief in the ETH 2.0 network You have to remember when you lock your Ethereum up in the staking contract, thats a one-way trip. [It] goes in, doesnt come back out.

XRP price had a good run this weekend, coming off the low of $0.627 from Friday.
The negative turn this morning bounced off a multi-week descending trend line.
With another triangle formation, Ripple is made or break for the run higher toward $0.784.
XRP price was blessed as well this weekend with the overall positive recovery in cryptocurrencies The majors like Bitcoin and Ethereum made solid profits, but sentiment shifted onwith profit-taking that erased the gains from the past weekend.
XRP price still has a chance to shoot higher
Ripple made a solid recovery this weekend, coming from $0.626 toward $0.707, a 13% move to the upside that got squared during the Asian session on Monday. The top cryptocurrencies could not hold their gains and dragged the rest of the marketwith them to the downside, pairing losses.
That does not mean there is notmore upside though. The trend broke lower when XRP price broke the symmetrical triangle to the downside, testing $0.626. Ripple moved higher after a bounce off that level toward $0.708, whichlooks to fall in line with the high of the candle that causedthe break to the downside out of the extensive triangle formation from last week.
In the meantime, it seemslike this weekend XRP price entered a new triangle that is squeezing it into a smaller range with higher lows and lower highs. Again a break to the downside looks set, but a test at $0.626 should be a signal for buyers to come back in.
The reason for buyers to step in is the fact that nothing fundamental has changed to the markets. Overall risk-on sentiment in markets globally is still present, and negative news surrounding cryptocurrencies and legislation is falling into the background.
XRP/USD daily chart
The break to the downside in XRP price out of the smaller triangle should not be a red flag for buyers. Just below, Ripple has the $0.626 level that held during the weekend to the downside Should Ripple break lower, look for the $0.50 marker as an excellent position to buy the dip.

Major cryptocurrencies are down on Monday despite a slight rally over the weekend, with bitcoin trading around 3% lower at $34,231 and Ethereum losing 3% at $2,272.
By Monday morning, the broader cryptocurrency market had also lost more than 2.8% of its value, data provider CoinMarketCap states.
A record high for bitcoin earlier this year  over $64,000 in mid-April  drove the broader cryptocurrency market to reach a value of more than $2 trillion. Since that time, the crypto market has lost over half its value and is currently worth around $1.4 trillion.
Crypto per carat! Sotheby's to accept cryptocurrency for diamond auction
Last month, bitcoin suffered a daily plunge of over 11%, dragging the cryptocurrency down to its lowest level this year  $28,993. The drop came after the Peoples Bank of China summoned banks and payment companies and ordered them to stop facilitating crypto transactions in a further step of the nationwide crackdown on cryptocurrencies. Growing concerns about bitcoins energy use also added to stalling momentum for the crypto market.
However, experts say its not over for bitcoin  or cryptocurrencies in general.
When you go too high, too fast, you are bound for a correction,Alex Mashinsky, chief executive officer and co-founder of the centralized cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius, told Cointelegraph at Bitcoin 2021 in Miami. He also predicted that bitcoin could reach as high as $160,000 this year:
We havent seen the highs yet for 2021.
Bitcoin will go all the way to $160K this year, CEO of crypto lending platform predicts
Increased institutional adoption of the crypto also sends a positive message, with Sothebys, the worlds largest broker of fine art and jewelry, for instance, announcing in June it will accept cryptocurrency for the first time as payment for a rare diamond, which is expected to fetch up to $15 million at an upcoming auction in Hong Kong.

To The Moon, the worlds first music festival hosted virtually and live using Ethereum technology, will be held this Sunday in Decentraland
The festival project is the brainchild of a group from within the non-Fungible Token (NFT) community resulting from a partnership between leading NFT marketplace KnownOrigin NFT agency BEAR NFT and the IlluminoNFT collective.
The partnership was formed in response to the decline in live music events during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen the cancellation of major festivals such as Glastonbury.
The festival will be hosted in KnownOrigins virtual headquarters in Decentraland  an Ethereum-based virtual reality world  and will present a number of live online musical performances including artists such as Ookay, Fred Thurst, SNBRN, Autograf, and Win and Woo.
This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

Attendees can anticipate more than just music, with organisers announcing a collection of exclusive NFTs available during the course of the festival.
They will also be able to claim a virtual token for their Decentraland account utilising Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) technology, alongside exclusive avatar items such as virtual hats.
The festival begins at 6pm UTC on Sunday July 11.

What is Decentraland?
Decentraland is a VR platform that hosts a 3D world where people can buy, sell and manage virtual real estate called LAND. These plots of LAND  which are digital assets maintained in an Ethereum smart contract  are owned by members of the community, giving users complete control over what they do with their slice of the virtual world. Users can later navigate, build upon, and monetise their plots.
The amount of LAND is capped and each plot is 10m by 10m (33ft by 33ft), but theres no limit to the height. If you own adjacent plots, you can bond them together. Decentraland is home to Genesis City  a metropolis created by the development team to encourage centralised development.
Decentraland experiences are currently being built by thousands of LAND owners. Once theyre ready, youll be able to explore the world on your computer, phone, or VR headset.
Story continues
Owning LAND gives you full control over the environments and applications you create. This could range from static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games.
You can design 3D environments via a tool called the Builder  and you dont actually need to own LAND or hold $MANA to use it. Anyone can jump in and start landscaping parcels and estates.
The Builder doesnt take the place of an editor  it aims to make Decentraland accessible to ordinary folk.
Testing ideas is at the core of Decentraland, but its also caught the attention of investors who are snapping up plots of LAND in the hopes of turning a profit.
Today $Mana was trading at $0.55, with a 24% change of -4.5% during the time of writing and a trading volume of $48.4m.

Coinbase
NASDAQ:COIN
)
, America's leading cryptocurrency custodian and exchange, announced a new program that pays a 4% annual percentage yield (APY) on the stablecoin USD Coin
(
CRYPTO:USDC
)
. USDC is the world's second-largest stablecoin (behind Tether) and is backed by real U.S. dollars held in a bank. Since it can be redeemed at any time for one U.S. dollar, its price stays stable, hence the term ""stablecoin.""
If one USDC is equal to one U.S. dollar, why is Coinbase offering such a generous 4% interest rate? By comparison, the typical savings account pays far less than 1% per year on U.S. dollars. Let's dive into the details of Coinbase's USDC interest rate to determine just how ""risk-free"" it really is.
Image source: Getty Images.
Understanding USDC
Coinbase and Circle were the two principal founders of Centre, the institution in charge of USDC. In May 2018, the consortium published the Centre whitepaper. According to the whitepaper, Centre is intended to provide:
A mechanism for issuing members to mint and burn/redeem asset-backed fiat tokens, or ""stablecoins,"" to address price volatility
Protocols to enable global stablecoin transaction interoperability on public blockchains using state channels for increased throughput and scalability
Network membership rules and smart contracts to govern, audit, and manage the licensed network participants that mint, transact, and redeem stablecoins
Put another way, Centre was set up to make a fiat token that provides liquidity and stability to the crypto world
The relationship between the U.S. dollar and volatile cryptocurrencies
You may be thinking that it's rather ironic that a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar is playing such a critical role in the crypto economy. After all, this relationship goes against the passions articulated in the Bitcoin
(
CRYPTO:BTC
)
whitepaper. Reeling from the Great Recession, Bitcoin's founders were specifically trying to replace the U.S. dollarand the financial institutions that served as third-party intermediaries. However, Bitcoin doesn't need to replace fiat currency to be successful. In many ways, Bitcoin's value will be more compelling if it can thrive in the existing financial framework.
Institutional adoption, a hedge against inflation, and a globally recognized and secure store of value are just some of the reasons why famed growth investor Cathie Wood sees Bitcoin growing exponentiallyover the next decade. Her thesis, and others like it, have nothing to do with Bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar.
A successful relationship between the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrency is the message that companies like Coinbase are trying to drive home when they talk about USDC. As Coinbase notes in its reasons for building USD Coin: ""We want everyone to enjoy the stability of the world's fiat currency, the U.S. dollar. USD Coin allows unbanked and under-banked individuals in any country to hold a U.S. dollar-backed asset with nothing more than a mobile phone.""
Understanding USDC's risks
Nothing in this world is free. And that applies to USD's 4% interest rate.
In the fine print, Coinbase was clear that it is not a bank offering a U.S dollar savings account. And therefore, USDC is not FDIC or SIPC insured. While this stipulation may sound scary, it actually makes perfect sense. USDC may be tied to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. government has nothing to do with USDC. Since USDC isn't legal tender, it's not going to be insured by the U.S. government. However, issuers of Centre's USDC stablecoin are regulated and licensed financial institutions that are required to report their reserves every month, ensuring that each USDC is truly backed by one U.S. dollar.
The second biggest risk with USDC is that it is an Ethereum
(
CRYPTO:ETH
)
token hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. That means that it comes with all of the uncertainty associated with the Ethereum blockchain, such as cyber threats, as well as the feared ""51% attack"". A 51% majority interest could theoretically block commerce, implement fraudulent transactions, and disrupt the entire network. Given Ethereum's size and diversified interest, this would be incredibly difficult to pull off. But it is a risk, nevertheless.
The third risk has to do with the interest rate itself. Coinbase reserves the right to change the 4% APY. This presents a challenge to investment planning, as well as to retirees who may depend on a stable return to supplement their income.
Buyer beware
The crypto world is becoming more sophisticated, which opens the door to new financial products. Investors would do well not to take interest rate offerings for granted A quick Google search, and you'll see double-digit interest rates on stablecoins by unaccredited platforms. As Coinbase mentioned in its press release, it's important to read the full terms and conditions to make sure platforms aren't loaning your stablecoins to shady sources.
Despite Coinbase being one of the more reputable platforms, it's probably best not to invest in USDC solely for its interest rate unless you believe in the future of Bitcoin and Ethereum USDC may not be volatile, but it's tied to the crypto world and all the risks that come with it However, for investors looking to complement their crypto wallets with a cash position that earns a sizable interest rate, Coinbase's USDC offering looks like a very attractive deal.

Cardano price is a bit shaky after a weekend rebound, but gains are paired back on Monday.
The recent dip looks nice for a buy of ADA around $1.31.
A fan-formation shows a very sensible price reaction and confirms more upside.
Cardano price was among the victims this Monday morning in the sell-off that flooded cryptocurrency markets. Big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum trended higher during the weekend, butthey all paired gains and looked for support around Friday's levels.
Cardano pricemay look heavy, but nothinghas changed to risk-on mood
Investors must have had a perfect weekend watching their cryptocurrency portfolio increase in value. The feeling on Monday morning, however, must have undercut their euphoric feeling from Sunday evening. This weekend it looked like cryptocurrencies were out of the woods after a few weeks of heavy selling and the long road to what looked like recovery.
But no need to panic just yet.
A closer look at Cardano price action
shows
that it is respecting a fan technical play. The 1/1 trend line was very well supported on July 1, with buyers pushing ADA price toward $1.50.
We get confirmationthat this fan is being well respected as we see hours and days before the  fan line and the  fan line reflected in the wigs of the candles. Even the  fan is confirming the trend, whichis a technical indicator to be aware of.
Looking forward, this means that some further downside is possible for now, but the 1/1 fan line should be respected around $1.33. If that levelbreaks, Cardano price has the $1.30 psychological level and the $1.28 triple bottom from this weekend as additional support.
ADA/USD 4 hour chart
The rejection at $1.50 is standard. It is a fundamental psychological level and, for buyers, an excellent place to take some profit. But ifthe sell-off continues on this US holiday, look for Cardano price to testaround $1.20, which should fall in place with the 2/1 fan line.

Ether is the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network.

More than $13 billion has now been staked on the ethereum 2.0 network, as interest grows.
The ethereum network is moving towards a staking system as part of a major overhaul.
Users put forward a ""stake"" and gain the right to validate transactions and earn more coins.
Ether
holders have ""staked"" more than $13 billion worth of the cryptocurrency on the ethereum 2.0 network, as excitement builds around the overhaul of the system and the potential growth of the staking industry.
Network users have now staked more than 6.1 million ether, up from 5.3 million a month earlier. The total value of the staked ether was around $13.52 billion at Monday's price, data from Etherscanshowed.
The ethereum blockchain is going through some major changes collectively known as ethereum 2.0
At the centre is an overhaul of the way the network is secured and coins are created, from a ""proof-of-work"" system to a ""proof-of-stake"" system.
Under proof-of-stake, users put forward  or ""stake""  coins as a form of down payment. In return, they gain the right to validate transactions on the network and earn more tokens.

A crypto VC who made successful early gambles on Chainlink and Synthetix shares his next big under-the-radar bet  and breaks down 2 trends shaping DeFi
JPMorgan said last week that crypto staking could become a $40 billion industryby 2025, thanks in large part to the changes to the ethereum network, which will expand the market massively.
""The opportunities to 'earn' will grow meaningfully with the ethereum merge anticipated for later 2021, which will boost the size of the proof-of-stake ecosystem.""
Ethereum users are almost always required to stake 32 ether before they can become validators on the network and earn coins in return, meaning there were likely more than 190,000 validators as of Monday.
Network developers launched the ethereum 2.0 beacon chain last December, after more than 520,000 ether was deposited. Since then, the amount staked on the chain has grown by more than 10 times.
The plan is that ethereum will become a proof-of-stake network by the end of this year, or in early 2022. Ethereum currently uses the same proof-of-work system as bitcoin where huge amounts of computing power are required to solve complex puzzles to secure the network and ""mine"" new coins.

"Ethereum price prepares for a 40% advance to retest $3,000.
Twitter and Reddit launch ETH-based NFTs on Rarible and OpenSea, respectively.
EY announced to open-source Nightfall 3 to increase transaction efficiency by reducing gas fees via zero-knowledge proofs.
Ethereum price seems to have hit a local top for its recent slow but steady uptrend. A minor retracement into a demand zone is likely and necessary for the upswing that the bulls have been waiting for.
Twitter and Reddit step up their NFT game
Social media giant Reddit auctionedthree CryptoSnoos, NFTs built on the Ethereum blockchain on OpenSea. Helium, Original Block and Snoopremaitc were the auctionedNFTs sold for 105, 175, and 115 ETH, respectively.
Kraken CEO Jesse Powel participated in the bid and acquiredthe Snoopermatic NFT.
Twitter followed Reddits lead and created eight NFTs for sale via 
The 140 Collection
 on Rarible.
These developments suggest that despite the slump in the general cryptocurrency market, the adoption of Ethereum-based applications is unaffected. Unlike Bitcoin, which can only be used as a store of value or speculative currency, the ETH blockchain accrues fundamental value and continues to improve.
Miners and network congestion
While the adoption of Ethereum continues to grow, the hash rate and the miner revenue plummet as ripples of Chinas digital currency mining clampdown propagate.
ETH hash rate dropped from 643 terra hash per second (TH/s) on May 20 to 499TH/s on July 4, representing a 22% decline. On a similar note, the Ethereum miner revenue shrunk by 53% between May and June.
Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, which is said to take effect inthe London hardforkin late July, will change the natureof how fees are collected via transactions. Additionally, this EIP will be user-focused and might negatively affectminers while vastly improving the scalability of ETH.
Therefore, the recent 53% drawdown is another gut-punch to Ether miners, who are migratingto regulatory-friendly countries after the recent mining ban in China.
ETH hash rate chart
While EIP-1559 will help ETH with scaling and reducing gas fees, Ernst and Youngs Nightfall 3 is another significant milestone in this regard.
According to a recent announcement Nightfall 3, a Layer 2 protocol, was open-sourcedon July 1. The latest release, albeit experimental, will complete Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) transactions for roughly 10 kGas compared to 700 kGas for the original Nightfall application, with a potential reduction of up to 8 kGas via pending updates.
Ethereum price eyes retest of range highs
Ethereum price is still in the range like most altcoins and the flagship cryptocurrency. However, the recent run-up between June 23 to date has set up three higher highsand two higher lows. When these swing points are connected using trend lines, a rising wedge pattern forms.
This setup forecasts a 16% downswing to $1,909, determined by measuring the distance between the first swing high and low and adding it to the breakout point at $2,271. Therefore, a decisive close below the lower trend line coinciding with the support level at $2,271 will indicate a breakout.
While the technical formation predicts a 16% crash, the demand zone ranging from $2,041 to $2,106 could absorb the selling pressure and halt it.
If this were to happen, it would indicate the presence of buyers and propel Ethereum price upward by 10% to retest the midpoint of the range at $2,320. A decisive close above this level opens up the path to $2,912.
The move to $2,912 or $3,000is expected to be a slow climb with minor retracements at $2,460 and $2,640.
If the bid orders continue to pile up after tagging $3,000, ETH might likely retest the resistance level at $3,240.
ETH/USDT 1-day chart
Supporting the short-term price drop from the rising wedge pattern is the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) model, hovering around 26.2%.
This fundamental index measures the profit/loss of investors who purchased ETH over the past year. The current value represents that 26.2% of the market participants that bought Ether are still in profit.
Therefore, these investors might want to book profit, pushing Ethereum price lower.
Ethereum 365-day MVRV chart
The supply on exchanges confirms that Ethereum price remains bullish from a long-term perspective. Over the past three months, this metric has dropped from 22.2 million to 20.8 million ETH.
This 6% plummet indicates that investors are moving their holdings from exchange to cold wallets as they are confident in Ethereum price performance over the upcoming months.
ETH supply on exchanges chart
Further strengthening the case for $3,000 is the increase in whales holding between 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 ETH after a month of stagnation.
The total number of these investors in this category went from 8 to 9 between May 19 and June 17, which is a bullish confirmation of their investment thesis.
ETH supply distribution
On the flip side, if Ethereum price fails to hold above the demand zone, extending from $2,041 to $2,106, the rising wedges target at $1,909 could be tagged.
A potential spike in selling pressure that pushes ETH to produce a decisive daily candlestick close below the range low at $1,728 will invalidate the bullish thesis and open the path for further down moves.

Crypto-related email attacks jump 192% amid growing Bitcoin buzz
Growing crypto buzz has also triggered an increase in crypto-related cyberattacks. Particularly crypto-related email compromise attacks have increased by 192 percent during October 2020-May 2021 period, according to global cloud security solutions firm Barracuda. The researchers at Barracuda identified that the growing price of bitcoin has led to an increase in the volume of cryptocurrency-related attacks. India was among the countries with the highest cryptocurrency mining encounters and drive-by download attacks during the year, according to the updated India findings unveiled by Microsoft in July 2020 of its Security Endpoint Threat Report 2019. In 2019 crypto-related ransom demands ranged from a few thousand dollars to $2 million, according to Barracuda, while by mid-2021 most demands were in the millions, with a significant number over $20 million.

NFTs find credibility among Indians as crypto fever continues
As high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) continue to invest in cryptocurrencies and seek to diversify their portfolio, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are slowly gaining asset-class credibility. Indians are also warming up to this new digital asset that has given creators and collaborators a fresh platform to earn better moolah while generating more value for their work. NFTs allow people to buy and sell ownership of unique digital items in cryptocurrencies, and keep track of who owns them using the Blockchain. NFTs can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, artworks, tweets, animated GIFs, songs or even video games. (The Economic Times)

The data on BitInfoChartsrevealsmore than what Santiment has put out. To understand the magnitude of the fall in the number of Bitcoin's active addresses, let's sample these numbers. On April 15, 2021, Bitcoin had a gargantuan 1.14 million active addresses. On June 27, it bottomed out at just over 462,800 addresses.
On those same dates, the price of Bitcoin in Indiawent fromRs. 47.2 lakh per Bitcoin (quite close to its peak)to Rs. 23.9 lakh, as per historicaldata on Coinbase or almost the lowest Bitcoin has been valued at in 2021. That is still higher than it was valued in the past, although the bull rush of the early part of the year seems to be behind us now.
Ether, on the other hand, had a little over 751,000 addresses on April 15. On June 28, its numbers had increased to over 926,900 addresses when Bitcoin was at just about618,900 addresses.The dip in the number of Bitcoin's active addresses could meanthat people are selling off their digital assets at a record pace.
The Ether price in INRpeaked in May, later than Bitcoin, reaching Rs. 3.2 lakh per token on May 12 as per Coinbase's historical data On April 15, Ether was trading at Rs. 1.82 lakh, and wentto Rs. 1.47 lakhon June 28.
Now, the only question many had on their minds was if Ethereum would sustain the momentum. Well, the answer is no. On July 3, Bitcoin was once again at the top with roughly 823,287 active addresses to Ethereum's approximate 683,608 users.
On July 5, the largest cryptocurrency was tradingat Rs 25,59,872 following a 2.17% fall in its prices. Ethereum, on the other hand, traded at Rs 169,245 after taking a .21% hit in the last 24 hours. While Bitcoin's current market cap is about $642.54 billion, nearly three times that of Ethereum's $265.38 billion.

Odds Boosting Ethereum Bulls Stay Above $2,000
The flagship altcoin bounced back strongly above $ 2,250 this week. As of Monday, it stayed above such key support levels with global investors and traders remaining optimistic about Ethereum.

At the time of drafting this report, Ethereumbulls are holding around $2,270, with the altcoin posting weekly gains of slightly over 15% amid lackluster performance seen in a number of leading Crypto assets including Bitcoin.
Traders are increasingly buying into this digital asset over its upcoming London hard fork and the prospect that its arch-rival, Bitcoin remains in firm support.

In addition, market experts from JP Morgan Chase, the worlds most valuable bank by market value argue in a report released a few days ago, that blockchains running more energy-efficient networks would increase their adoption, including a unique way in earning income in a process called staking, as a source of revenue for institutional and retail investors alike.
The report also gave valuable insights on how Ethereum can disrupt the estimated $9 billion staking industry.
The long-anticipated Ethereumupgrade will definitely boost the adoption of such an alternative consensus mechanism and could make staking pay-outs explode to as high as $20 billion in the quarters following the launch of Ethereum 2.0 and $40 billion in four years time.
The long-awaited London hard fork upgrade will be in full deployment this month with such an upgrade expected to boost the value of Ethereum thanks to the highly anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) and other upgrades that include the shift to the eco-friendly proof-of-stake unison and a new rarity feature that will limit the number of tokens in circulation.
Market commentators remain bullish on the utility of crypto with leading social media platforms like Twitter publishing about 140 non-fungible tokens on Ethereum despite its Jack Dorsey preference in sticking to Bitcoin only.

""We are possibly looking at a good start to the week after there was some profit booking. The possibility of Ether decoupling from Bitcoinand not following the latter's price movements is becoming clearer. Investor attention is turning towards the largest Altcoin.

Tech View by Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX
Bitcoin looks ready for a reversal to an uptrend. If all goes well, we should see Bulls coming back to crypto markets in the coming month if the stock markets sustain the current levels. Ethereumlooks strong as compared to Bitcoin which is good news for the Alt season. The DEFI sector has shown strong bounce back as seen in the previous market cycle.
Agencies
SANDBOX is showing strength amongst the NFT pack. NFT has been the talk of the town and in the last 6-8 months, have bought a lot of artists & musicians to crypto with some record breaking sales. We could see NFT markets leading this alt season, only time will tell us.
All in all, markets are performing within the trend lines but they are usually with surprises to shake away some final disbelievers so be careful, don't leverage trade. If we get out of this phase it's a good sign for Bitcoin and last 2months consolidation will help it make new highs.

The number of initiatives dedicated to scaling the ethereum blockchain is manifold. Ethereum 2.0, Plasma, Raiden, zk-SNARKs  the list goes on.
On Monday, blockchain research and development startup Matter Labs announced a $2 million seed round led by Placeholder VC to develop a new scaling initiative atop the ethereum blockchain.
Speaking to the goals of the initiative, Matter Labs co-founder Alex Gluchowski said:
Our product will be much more scalable [than ethereum today] without sacrificing decentralization or security.  You will be able to deposit any funds on it and it will be as safe as depositing on ethereum itself.
Matter Labs technology is based on a novel form of cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) Leveraging this mathematical magic, in the words of Gluchowski, transactions on ethereum could be significantly sped up and cheaper to deploy.
With what were building  payments [on ethereum] will be very cheap and have very high throughput, said Gluchowski. Not only very cheap but predictively cheap because the bulk of the cost will be coming from [ZKP] computation.
At the same time, Gluchowski told CoinDesk the research into leveraging ZKPs as a scaling solution on ethereum is still very early. At present, Matter Labs has built a prototypeof its scalable payments platform and is working towards creating a new minimum viable product over the coming months.
Investor buy-in
A number of other venture capital firms joined Placeholder in the funding round, including 1kx, Dekrypt, Hashed and Dragonfly Capital Partners.
Hashed CEO and managing partner Simon Seojoon Kim told CoinDesk:
We believe the on-chain data availability and  scaling solution the Matter Labs team is building will be the integral piece in accelerating the growth of [ethereums decentralized finance] space.
Dekrypt co-founder Howard Wu also added that using ZKPs to wrap hundreds of thousands of transactions on ethereum into succinct, verifiable proofs is a really cool way to try and bring scalability to ethereum.
Launched officially in December 2018, Matter Labs has also received funding from the Ethereum Foundation, the oldest non-profit dedicated to ethereum protocol development.
Gluchowski said Matter Labs has received over $100,000 in several different grants from the Ethereum Foundation over the course of 2019.

Sygnum Bank reveals that it has become one of the first banks to provide Ethereum 2.0 staking support.
Customers are able to easily and securely stake Ethereum (ETH)via Sygnums institutional-grade banking service which can help with generating a substantial yield of up to 7% yearly.
As a pioneer and leader in bringing new digital asset products to the regulated space, Sygnum is committed to further expanding its product offering of competitive yet regulated yield generating products like digital asset staking.
As explained in the announcement, staking services will be fully-integrated into
Sygnum
s banking services with an intuitive, user-friendly setup. With Ethereum powering the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi)apps, staking is a great choice for long-term ETH investors looking for lucrative yields.
Sygnum continues to expand its extensive portfolio of crypto-asset yield generating products with Ethereum 2.0 staking. Sygnum, the first digital asset bank, has confirmed that clients can provide Ethereum from their existing wallets to generate a relatively high yield or rate of return. This offer may seem great when we consider that bank deposits are not providing any returns with some banks even charging clients for holding their funds.
As covered, staking involves locking up digital assets in order to take part in the validation of transactions on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain networks, with a financial incentive offered in exchange.
Sygnum has also been providing staking for Tezos (XTZ), and a yield-generating fixed term deposit on its Digital Swiss Franc stablecoin (DCHF).
Thomas Eichenberger, Head of Business Units at Sygnum Bank, stated:
Ethereum is the second largest blockchain protocol, and Ethereum staking is a core element for digital asset portfolios which can now be accessed in a convenient, secure and regulated setting. This further expands Sygnums offering of attractive, regulated yield generating products to meet the needs of clients to accumulate other forms of return in addition to capital appreciation.
Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform with a market cap of over $250 billion. The majority of DeFi protocols are running on Ethereum. The DeFi space has been growing exponentially with Total Value Locked or TVL in the ecosystem growing over 3x since the beginning of this year.
Ethereum 2.0 promises greater overall efficiency with considerably lower environmental impact, improved scalability and better security, which should help with ideally positioning the DLT network for future growth.
Staking has been part of the initial phase on the roadmap to Ethereum 2.0, which had gone live in December of last year (and the introduction of the Beacon Chain). The complete upgrade and transition to ETH 2.0 should take around a year. The new blockchain has proven to be stable so far, with over $13 billion worth of Ethereum being staked.
Thomas Brunner, Head of Accounts and Custody at Sygnum Bank remarked:
Sygnum clients can participate in the new proof-of-stake Ethereum and benefit from potentially higher staking rewards now. This is a compelling choice for long-term investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.

"The apple.eth domain has been grabbed with no way to get it back, thanks to an exploit of an auction by the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS), a domain registration service for the ethereum network.
The auction kicked off on Sept. 1 and was run by digital collectibles marketplace OpenSea, which
disclosed
the exploit Monday and published an updateon the issue today.
Taking full responsibility for the bug, OpenSea said 17 names in total were taken by the hacker, including other notable ones such as defi.eth, wallet.eth, and pay.eth.
The bug in the auction software had distributed ENS domains to participants who did not hold the highest bid, according to the post.
Further, OpenSea stated:
One user discovered an input validation vulnerability that allowed them to place bids on a name that actually issued a different name.
Further issues with the auction process affected some 30 domain names like bitmex.eth or hodls.eth, with bids incorrectly processed. None of these domains were involved in the exploit, however.
An alternative web standard to the internet domain service, DNS, ENS operates on the ethereum blockchain. Unlike DNS, domain names cannot be forcibly retrieved once allocated to a party, thanks to the immutability of the ledger the information is stored on.
OpenSea explained:
A blessing and a curse of blockchain-based digital assets is that once they have been distributed, it is impossible for them to be revoked. We cant redo the auctions for the names that were sold in an invalid fashion.
As such, the firm has asked for the domain names to be returned so they can be re-auctioned. A reward of 25 percent of the final auction price plus the original bid will be given to the hacker, the blog states.
Apple.eth and the 16 other hacked domains have been blacklisted by OpenSea. ENS is considering blacklisting the names as well.

Ethereums long-awaited London hard fork is likely to launch on Aug. 4 between 13:00 UTC and 17:00 UTC, with block 12,965,000. Many Ethereum enthusiasts are excited for the delayed release, while some are watching on with 
cautious optimism.

As a part of a roadmap designed to lead up to the release of Ethereum 2.0, which will replace Ethereums current proof of work protocol with proof of stake , the London hard fork has been implemented into various testnets. After successful activation on the Ropsten and Goerli testnets, the final hard fork release date was decided.",2021-07-06,0.7845,0.097,0.084,0.819
"CRYPTO:ETH
)
, the tokens native to the Ethereum blockchain, was going up on Tuesday. As of 3:20 p.m. EDT today, the price had risen almost 4% over the previous 24-hour period, according to CoinDesk. While a move like this is certainly inside of what's considered normal for volatile cryptocurrencies, we can't discount a major update about a change coming to the network.
So what
At 10:40 this morning, a developer for Ethereum proposed a date for an update called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), or the London hard fork. Assuming other developers agree, the update will be scheduled to take place on Aug. 4. The main thing that EIP-1559 should bring is a change to Ethereum's fee structure.
Image source: Getty Images.
Right now, if you want to transact with Ether, you blindly bid what you're willing to pay in transaction fees, which can lead to overpaying. EIP-1559 might not reduce fees, but it will regulate them. More importantly, a certain amount of Ether will get ""burned"" with transactions, disappearing from the supply completely.
To clarify, Ether was launched with an annual limit of 18 million new tokens. So it's an inflationary cryptocurrency. The rate of inflation has gone down every year as the circulating supply has grown. But by introducing the new burn structure with EIP-1559, it's possible for Ether to become deflationary with enough transactions to offset the new supply. The move toward the London hard fork could be what's rallying investors to Ether today.
Now what
There's a lot going on with Ethereum these days besides the London hard fork. A bigger update is called Ethereum 2.0 which should make the network more scalable, handling higher volume and solving the current congestion to the blockchain. Investing in cryptocurrencieslike Ether isn't for the faint of heart because they're volatile and the price of Ether could reverse tomorrow. But I believe the London hard fork and Ethereum 2.0 are generally good developments. By solving key problems with this technology, it could make it more practical and usable long term.

"PrimeXBT
market analyst Kim Chua believes.
With decentralized finance (DeFi) only to grow in popularity, it provides good support for ETH, given that 90 per cent of demand is from DeFi, Chua explained in a recent research note. Further support has been provided from investors who use ETH as collateral and as fuel for yield farming on the ETH blockchain. NFTs add to ETHs use cases but their effects have been comparatively minor to date.
ETH has faced some competition for DeFi use from the likes of Polygon and Binance Smart Chain, as the industry looks for alternatives to high gas fees and slow speeds. What works against those competitors is many have faced hacks resulting in billions of lost funds from protocols such as Venus and Bunny.

However, as the market started to turn downwards in May, exploits on DeFi projects were getting one too many with projects on other blockchains, while none were observed with those on ETH, Chua said.
This was before the collapse of Iron Finance, which wiped out billions, Chua added.
It is appearing that the very reasons why these projects were successful became the very reason of their failure to take off, Chua added. Being cheap and fast allows bad actors to take advantage because it costs a scammer close to nothing to create a new protocol and they are able to get funds out of the protocol before being detected because the blockchain is fast. Perhaps ETHs higher gas fee and slower speed may be the very reason why exploits there are rare. Because it is more expensive to interact with ETH, projects and users there tend to think more long-term and could be less degenerate.
As a result of these issues Binance Smart Chain and Polygon have shed funds from DeFi projects over the past two months, Chua noted. Total value locked on BSC plummeted from $30 billion to around $10 billion while it fell from $11 billion on Polygons MATIC to $4.3 billion. The MATIC token shed 65 per cent at its worst point in the sell-off. There have been slight rebounds, with BSC up to $13 billion and MATIC up to $5 billion. The BNB token is now at $290, which is 60 per cent below its all-time high. At $1.10 MATIC is 55 per cent below its peak.
While ETHs value also dropped in the 60 per cent level down to $1,700, total value down on the protocols was not as bad but a still significant 42 per cent. That 20 per cent discrepancy between ETH value and TVL has held, with ETH roughly 55 per cent below its peak and the TVL around 35 per cent lower than peak.
This reveals that unlike the other two competitors, the fall in ETH price is more drastic in proportion to its fall in TVL, which could suggest that the selling in ETH is overdone, Chua said. ETH, a leader in the smart contract blockchain place, which ought to give it a price premium, is now seemingly trading at a disproportionate price discount to TVL as compared with its peers. This could thus mean that either ETH is undervalued, or that the other two blockchains are overvalued.
Which one is it? Even during the drop-off the number of DeFI users continues to develop with an aggressive growth trajectory, Chua observed.

Valuation in an industry which is growing aggressively should have a premium, which means they ought to command premium valuation. Hence, this in no way suggests that a lower valuation estimate should be warranted for blockchains doing DeFi. In this regard, ETH is not overvalued. ETH is in fact, rather undervalued, since ETH is now also on track with some major upgrades as imminent as July.
Part of the reason for the fall could be due to what Chua said were greedy investors taking on high leverage positions under the cover of hype related to pending system upgrades.

With price settling into consolidation after the bulk of the liquidation done, investors looking for value may do well accumulating ETH when its price is still currently undervalued,: Chua advised.
Should ETH 2.0 fail, its effect could be muted given that Vitalik Buterin has warned against an immediately smooth transition.

It thus seems that there is more room for upside surprise should the key upgrade manage to yield better-than-expected results in fee reduction as well as in reducing the supply of ETH in the market. ETH looks to me a good buy at current level of around $2,000, Chua concluded.

Eighty-three percent of analysts have a Buy rating, and 12% rate the stock a Hold. The average target price is $740.40, which implies a downside of 11%.
To Vinh, his target price is justified because the companys flagship videogame chips are selling well and will continue to outstrip supply for the remainder of the year.
Investors have expressed concern over Nvidias growing sales of graphics chips to Ethereum cryptocurrency minersrecalling when a crash in crypto prices roughly three years ago led too much chip inventory, which damaged the companys revenue.
But Vinh brushed off concerns that the volatile cryptocurrency market will have substantial negative consequences for Nvidia.
Vinh wrote that Nvidias efforts to tweak its videogame chips mining abilities will effectively convince miners using graphics chips for Ethereum to buy the companys crypto-specific chips.

"Ethereum cryptocurrency owners have now staked more than $14 billion worth of their tokens on the Ethereum 2.0 network, Etherscan data shows.It marks a rise from around $13.5 billion staked on Monday, as reported by Markets Insider, which highlights the pace of the shift towards Ethereum 2.0.Ethereum 2.0 represents a fundamental change in how the Ethereum blockchain works.Staking explainedIn order to remain decentralizedthat is, operating without a central authoritycryptocurrency networks work by incorporating a consensus mechanism, which means all computers on that network can agree on what's going on at any given time without a central bank intermediary.This means everyone's computer can agree on which transactions have taken place, for example, instead of a bank keeping track of it.Ethereum, like Bitcoin, uses a consensus mechanism known as proof of work (PoW), in which people use computing power to keep the network up to date in return for new tokens. This process is better known as mining.But proof of work has issues, such as high energy consumption and prohibitively strict hardware requirements. It sees network users compete for the chance to update the network by updating it with all the new transactions that have taken place.Another consensus mechanism, called proof of stake (PoS), may eliminate some of the problems associated with proof of work.A proof of stake mechanism sees cryptocurrency users contribute to network validation by depositing a certain amount of cryptocurrency into that network as a stake.They are potentially rewarded for this by being given new tokens in return for their stake, if they are the user that is chosen to update the network. A bigger stake means they are more likely to be chosen.Conversely, they will be punished by losing part of their stake if they attempt to attack the network, go offline, or fail to validate the network. Once a stake is made, it is essentially locked.A users' staked tokens act as a guarantee of the legitimacy of any new transactions they update the network with.The new version of Ethereum that is using PoS is called Ethereum 2.0. Users can stake their tokens in the Ethereum 2.0 network by sending their Ether to a deposit contract, which they must do by following instructions on Ethereum's Launchpad product.Generally, Ethereum users are required to stake 32 Etherworth roughly $73,600 as of 10:45 a.m. EDT on Tuesdayif they want to become validators on the new network.The Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain was launched by network developers in December 2020.",2021-07-06,0.8225,0.069,0.039,0.892

What is PolkaDot ?
Polkadot is a blockchain network which can be described as a blockchain of blockchains, or multichain. It is hard to define what Polkadot is because it is one of a kind object so we need to understand its structure first.
The project is maintained by a team led by Gavin Wood, the former CTO of the Ethereum project.
Problems with existing blockchains
Decentralisation, speed and security. For any blockchain you can think of, it is a game of choosing one or two out of the three. This is known as the blockchain trilemma. Lets examine a couple examples
Ethereum is successful because it has a convenient architecture for implementing smart contracts. But far too many people abuse its functionality and create useless projects like CryptoKitties. At the end of 2017, this project occupied almost 12% of the whole network, paralysing the transactions which also lead to skyrocketing fees.
EOS, on the other hand, offers almost instant transactions. However, it has nominated block validators which opens doors for manipulation. This is why EOS is considered by many as a very centralised network.
All blockchains make trade-offs to support certain features.
There is another issue which limits our transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Hundreds of public blockchains exist out there all serving specific purposes. All these networks are isolated from each other and no information can be exchanged between the projects. This is as if different banks or institutions were not allowed to interact with each other. Such lack of interoperability is preventing mass adoption of the blockchain technology.
Polkadot aims to resolve all of these problems.
Polkadot under the hood
The two main structural components of the Polkadot multichain are Relay chain and Parachains.
Relay chain is central to everything. It is responsible for security, consensus and cross-chain interoperability across the whole network, and has an intentionally reduced functionality. For example, smart contracts are not allowed.
Story continues
Relay chain, just like any other blockchain, has validators staked with DOT  Polkadots native currency  for using Proof of Stake to achieve consensus.
The validation mechanism is actually called Nominated Proof-of-Stake. Nominators bond their stake to particular validators in order to help them get recognized by the network and be allowed to mine the blocks. Profits and loses are shared with nominators. In this way, untrustworthy validators will be excluded from the system.
Parachains are blockchains that connect to the Relay chain and delegate their consensus and security computations to it. In this way, parachains become fast and congestion-free.
Each parachain can still has its own governance rules but it must be able to pass blocks that the Relay chain can understand. The job of transitioning from a given parachain to the Relay chain is done by special nodes called Collators.
Parachains are built to serve a single purpose. For example, one of them might be good for fast transactions while another is designed for smart contract implementation.
Parachains and Parathreads
While Relay chain is permanent, parachains can disconnect and connect back to the network. The connection is established on a subscription basis  similar to monthly payments you make to Netflix to watch its content.
Parachains are blockchains that run constantly and lease their space in the Polkadot network by locking the funds for the duration of the lease.
Parathreads use a pay-as-you-go model. Parathreads are blockchains that need to be woken up and run less frequently.
What makes Polkadot especially good?
At the moment, almost 100 parachains can be connected to the multichain, signifying a previously unseen level of scalability and speed. A fully operational system is predicted to be able to process up to 1,000,000 transactions/second. And all of this while remaining genuinely decentralised  we dont need to worry about the trilemma anymore.
By design, parachains and parathreads can communicate. Even existing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum could join the Polkadot family via so called bridges. This resolves the isolation issue we discussed about existing blockchains.
In addition, the costs of running such networks are significantly reduced because there is effectively one chain (Relay) responsible for operation.
Another important advantage of Polkadot is being developer- friendly. The majority of parachains are built using Substrate, a modular framework that allows blockchains to be built to specification within hours. Since the Relay Chain is built on Substrate, any Substrate-based blockchain can easily connect to the network.
The future
The Relay Chain of the Polkadot Network has been live since May 2020.
Kusama can be thought of as a test network for Polkadot. Right now, the functionality of the Polkadot protocol is being tested on this network. A special mechanism of distributing subscriptions to parachains  called
candle auctions
 is also checked.
There is a lot of trust in the future of Polkadot as more than 100 projects (KILT, Acala, Edgeware, Centrifuge, Katal, Polymath etc) have already decided to use the Polkadot mechanisms in the past months.

Cardano leapfrogs Bitcoin as eToro clients' most-held cryptocurrency
Darren Parkin
whatsapp
Investors are showing signs of becoming increasingly confident in the potential of smaller cryptocurrencies, despite this quarters market correction, with new eToro data revealing increases in the numbers of cryptoassets being held during the last quarter (Q2).
Perhaps surprisingly, Cardanos ADA has leapfrogged Bitcoin to become the most held in the second quarter of 2021, seeing a 51 per cent increase on the previous quarter. Bitcoin, which led the cryptoasset bull run at the start of the year, remained popular with a 42 per cent increase in demand.
However, it was eclipsed by ADA and slipped from first to second place.
Simon Peters, crypto market analyst at eToro said the growth and use case potential for Cardanos native ADA token had clearly provided plenty of attraction for investors.
During Q2, Cardano provided a clearer roadmap for its upcoming Alonzo hardfork  currently in a testing phase, he said.
If successful, it will bring smart contract functionality by allowing the writing and deployment of smart contracts for the first time on the Cardano blockchain.
This upgrade will be significant as it will enable developers to build projects on the network, helping Cardano to position itself as a real competitor to the likes of Ethereum.
The price of ADA climbed 15 per cent over the last quarter, suggesting investor optimism around the Alonzo hard fork and Cardanos ability to challenge Ethereum long-term.
Popularity gains
Ethereum, which has seen a 220 per cent price rise so far this year, also gained in popularity with a 79 per cent increase in investors holding the asset. This is ahead of the highly-anticipated London hardfork, slated for later this month, which will see increased functionality added to the network and preparation for the Serenity (
ETH
2.0) upgrade scheduled for next year. It will also see the EIP-1559 update which will change how gas fees are paid on Ethereum 1.0 going forward. This will see base fees adjusted to market rates, with the option of speeding up transactions by tipping miners.

Ethereum 2.0 interest is giving a boost to crypto markets
Cryptoassets have had an exciting year, with big milestones achieved in terms of price movements and increased institutional investment signalling more adoption by the traditional financial services ecosystem, added Simon Peters.
This emerging asset class continues to revolutionise many aspects of financial services and the long-term fundamentals remain strong. However, as we have seen over the past few months, there will be bumps along the way, and we expect volatility to continue.
Weve seen issues such as energy usage becoming major talking points and the next few months will likely see more exciting developments. We may well see a greater proportion of renewable energy sources supporting miners and other countries taking Chinas place as the leading asset miner following its recent ban.
No matter the headlines we urge retail investors to be mindful of the risks when investing in crypto and to do their research before investing.

Thats because it was able to rise in price while all of the crypto space fell dramatically. Its understandable that this ignited a lot of new interest in the company and the cryptocurrency.
That isnt to say that interest wasnt there prior to it bucking the price downtrend in April.
Solana had already caught fire in late December. It had basically traded between $1 and $2 before then. It took off from there, skyrocketing from $1.50 in December to $58 by mid May.
Over the course of the last year it has appreciated in price by 4,255%.
Didnt Escape Recent Trouble
Ultimately Solana couldnt escape the broad crypto downdraft that began in mid May. Yet, theres plenty of news that suggests it has real potential.
That potential means that it should likely rise from this latest downturn.
Interest remains high in Solana in any case. A good portion of that interest is a product of SOLs inherent strengths.
Many pundits are repeating the idea that Solana may be an alternative to
Ethereum
ETH-USD
).
In an effort to understand cryptocurrency economists have drawn comparisons from our current financial and economic systems. Ethereum is attempting to establish itself as the energy source, or oil for the internet and the decentralization of finance.
But there are problems with ETH as internet oil. Like oil, ETH is expensive. The average transaction fee associated with Ethereum over the last 24 hours is $3.51.
According to
Coinlist
it costs $10 for 1 milliontransactions through SOL. So, $10 for 1 million transactions through SOL as opposed to $10 for roughly 3 transactions through ETH.
Solana Versus Ethereum
Then theres the issue of transaction bandwidth. This is essentially speed or how much can be processed in a given period of time.
Solana claims that it can process up to 50,000 transactions per second. Ethereum supports about 1.2 million transactions over 24 hours. That works out to 13.88 transactions per second during that period.
It is said that the Ethereum 1.0 network can support a maximum of 30 transactionsper minute. The Ethereum 2 network upgrade is anticipated to support upwards of 100,000 transactions per second.
But the transition to Ethereum 2.0 may not occur until late 2021 or perhaps into 2022.
The argument is that SOL and its 50,000 current transactions per second make it much more attractive than waiting for Ethereum 2.0, which may or may not reach that 100k per second transaction throughput.
Thus, some have gone so far as to suggest that Solana will be an ETH killer because of its speed and transaction costs.
Users are certainly complaining about the transaction costs of ETH. But at the same time, theyre willing to pay for security in these early days of crypto. Thus, ideas that suggest Solana can usurp Ethereum quickly or easily are overblown.
Bright Future?
There are several signals indicating Solana has a bright future. Traditionally, venture capital investment is considered a strong indication that a project has the right ingredients for success.
From that perspective Solana is in good company. Solana recently raised $314 millionto fund its technological development. Andreessen Horowitz, one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital firms led the round of funding.
There have also been suggestions that Solana could be used to develop high-frequency trading algorithms which could benefit from its high TPS.
All of this makes Solana worth paying attention to for crypto enthusiasts.
Demand should rise as the crypto market learns more about SOL. There will be more liquidity in the markets as a consequence, and SOL prices should therefore run higher.

Ethereum 2.0 interest is giving a boost to cryptocurrency markets
Darren Parkin
whatsapp
Interest in Ethereums upcoming upgrade looks to be giving Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency markets the shot in the arm it needs to escape the current slump in digital assets.
It is believed around 6.5 Ether have already been staked on the Ethereum 2.0 network as the value of staked coins approaches $14bn. It means almost 200,000 deposits have been made into the contract address for ETH 2.0, which shows interest has exploded 10-fold since developers lit the 2.0 beacon last year.
Coupled with the much-anticipated London fork this month, Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to supercharge Ethereum towards eating up more of Bitcoins dominant market share.
ETH 2.0 is expected to have the capacity to process around 100,000 transactions every second, as well as creating a more sustainable network and a less intensive mining process. Critics have often complained about various niggles which have plagued Ethereum throughout its six-year lifespan, and if 2.0 can address those well-documented issues, the shackles could quickly come off, allowing Ethereums recent growth to accelerate unhindered.
The current enthusiasm around 2.0 and London has already started to take effect in the market as a whole. With the London fork only days away, ETH closed Monday above $2,300 before levelling up towards $2,350.
Analysts have been hoping to see Ethereum hold steady above $2,300 for some time, looking for a clear signal that Vitalik Buterins brainchild is ready to come of age.
More widely encouraging is the effect Ethereums wave of fervour is having across the rest of the markets.
Significant stepping stone
Bitcoin, so often the leader that all other currencies follow, had been floundering dangerously close to the precarious $33,000 level up until yesterday. However, buoyed by Ethereums robust movement, trading has picked up and lifted BTC closer to securing ground above $35,000  a significant stepping stone towards propelling the original cryptocurrency back to $40k+ territory that investors crave.
Others are also following suit. Cardanos well-loved native ADA has positioned itself on a level $1.45 after spending time struggling to find a foothold around $1.40.
Binances BNB has also lifted itself from the sub $300 doldrums to set up camp at around $320 today  a pitch it hasnt visited since last month.
All in all, the markets are chalking up an average rise of around three per cent over the past 24 hours, a figure which seems a little insignificant in many eyes. However, when set against the backdrop of repeated descents over the last few weeks, this modest lift, paired with a flurry of interest in Ethereums next metamorphic process, could well be viewed as the turning point which brings cryptocurrency out of its current sulk.

Ethereum
(ETH) is the second biggest cryptocurrency and dominates the altcoin market, with 18 per cent of the overall market capitalization. Along with Bitcoin (BTC), ETHs price actions guide other altcoin prices. Over the past few weeks, ETH has been consolidating after dropping by almost $1,000 from its last (local) peak. On Monday, Ethereum continued the recovery it had been building over the weekend, breaking resistance at $2,263 with a new local high of near $2,400 in anticipation of its hugely significant EIP 1559 platform update coming later this month.
ETMarkets.com
Currently, it seems to be making a rising wedge that has room to grow till $2,600 levels. Given the rising wedge symbolizes a bearish trend, ETH price movements right now might be a bull trap. Even though it may take some time for a rising wedge to break down, it is essential to note that currently, BTC is making a wedge and has room to move sideways. Therefore, the weekly closing will be critical in determining ETHs future action. As ETH trades below its 30D EMA and 50D EMA, and its fib-retracement level of $2,288, some bearishness can be expected.
Major Levels
Support: $2,044, $1,940, $1870

While crypto exchanges have demystified some of the largest cryptocurrencies for retail investors, many of the intricacies of decentralized finance are still lost on even more savvy investors as a result of DeFis weave of diverse offerings.
Zerion
, a startup building a decentralized finance interface for crypto investors, has attracted venture capitalist attention on the back of recent growth. Amid a renewed crypto gold rush, the company has processed more than $600 million in transaction volume so far this year, now with over 200 thousand monthly active users, CEO
Evgeny Yurtaev tells TechCrunch
The startup has also wrapped an $8.2 million Series A funding round led by Mosaic Ventures, with participation from Placeholder, DCG, Lightspeed, Blockchain.com Ventures, among others. Mosaics
Toby Coppel and Placeholders Brad Burnham have joined Zerions Board, the startup also shared.
Zerion gives customers access to more than 50,000 digital assets and 60 protocols on the Ethereum blockchain through their app which streamlines the UI of DeFi. Users can access tokens and invest through the app similar to exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini, but do so using their own personal wallets like MetaMask, meaning user funds and private keys arent controlled by or accessible to Zerion, a sticking point for Yurtaev, a life-long crypto enthusiast and builder.

Yurtaev says. 
In theory, its supposed to be easy to navigate, but in reality, its all a mess We try to demystify them.
Alongside major growth in Ethereum and Bitcoin prices, DeFi volume has surged in 2021, up from just under $20 billion at the years start to nearly $90 billion this May. The DeFi market et large has proven just as volatile as Bitcoin, with market volume falling some 35 percent in the past couple months to just over $57 billion.
The startups mobile app on iOS and Android has become a particularly popular way for crypto investors to track the market and the tokens theyre backing. The average user opens the app more than 9 times per day, the company says.
Cryptos 2021 upswing has drawn plenty of investor attention, not only to the assets themselves but to the platforms facilitating those transactions. Last month, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced that they had raised more than $2.2 billion to invest in startups building products in crypto spaces including decentralized finance.",2021-07-07,0.9667,0.076,0.017,0.907
"Ollie Leech, Coindesk Learn Editor, joined Yahoo Finance Live to break down why he thinks Ethereum is driving a lot of innovation in the crypto space right now.
Video Transcript
ADAM SHAPIRO:
All right, we've got just a little more than 15 minutes to the closing bell. I want to draw your attention to what's going on with Bitcoin. It's up about 670 bucks right now, $34,629 and change. But there's other cryptocurrencies out there. In fact, Goldman Sachs says pay attention to Ethereum.
We're going to pay attention to Ollie Leech. He's CoinDesk's learn editor. And Ollie, it's good to have you here. Help us understand, if you can, the Goldman call apparently this note leaked that they see Ethereum as potentially overtaking Bitcoin. What does that mean to those people who are buying Bitcoin today at over 34k?
OLLIE LEECH:
Well, I mean, it's something to diversify your portfolio for sure. A lot of maximalists will probably fire back at Goldman Sachs for those comments. But they've got a point for sure. Ethereum is driving a lot of the innovation in the space at the moment. They're responsible for the DeFi boom, the NFT boom that we all enjoyed at the start of this year.
But the main problem that they have is they have a lot of competition. And this is where Bitcoin kind of pulls away from Ethereum. It has a low supply, 21 million coins, which many people are aware of. And this is a big driver for its value. But it doesn't have really the same competition Ethereum does. We're seeing a lot of new blockchain projects step up to the NFT space, particularly the DeFi space, and they're all trying to eat Ethereum's lunch. So it's definitely a close call. We'll see how it goes.
SEANA SMITH:
Ollie, when we talk about regulation because, of course, that's been a big topic when we talk about not only Bitcoin, but really, crypto at large, and particularly what's going on over in China, I guess how big of a headwind do you see this being? And I know we talked to you about it in the past, but since then, we've gone headline after headline about how it could potentially disrupt the crypto markets going forward.
Story continues
OLLIE LEECH:
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, people have been talking about this kind of new level of enforcement that we're seeing in China right now. And it's true. You know, for the most part, even though these bans came out in 2013, 2017, we're really starting to see them amp up that enforcement now to start targeting these sort of fringe companies, companies that offer and facilitate crypto transactions there in the state indirectly.
So, you know, we go back last year. We were seeing these exchanges getting targeted. But now we're seeing software companies getting targeted as well. And what's interesting is China's stance has always been very, very clear from the get-go. When it started these bans, its message was, you know, do not offer-- facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. Otherwise, we will shut you down. And payment providers, software companies, anyone who engages in these sorts of activities now are going to get shut down.
ADAM SHAPIRO:
What about the fact that we keep having these hacks, these cyber attacks on international businesses? And they wish to be paid the ransomware in Bitcoin or in cryptocurrencies. How much longer till the sleeping giants of the world say, OK, enough of this, and that regulatory clampdown begins?
OLLIE LEECH:
Yeah, I mean, this is a big problem that Bitcoin is currently facing. And for a long time, we had that issue of Bitcoin being used for Silk Road for nefarious activities. But people also sort of shy away from the fact that through Bitcoin or through blockchain technology, we're actually able to track all of these payments. It's all transparent. Anyone can see where these payments are going. And in fact, through Bitcoin, some huge sort of dark web websites have been taken down purely because they were able to track the Bitcoin payments to them.
So it's kind of a double-edged sword situation. You know, it's not great publicity for Bitcoin. But it does have a traceability element that does help apprehend these sorts of funds. And we've already seen the FBI actually, through some unknown method, actually managed to break into the wallets and get that ransom back. And this may set the precedent for things to come and may even deter people from using Bitcoin in the future.
SEANA SMITH:
Ollie, do you look at the performance of Bitcoin during the second quarter? Obviously, there was a lot of volatility in the price of Bitcoin. We saw it significantly pull back from its highs. What do you think that means just in terms of the likely trading action that we'll see from Bitcoin over the remaining six months of the year?
OLLIE LEECH:
Yeah, sure. I mean, Bitcoin is very, very seasonal. And August is always-- we're coming up to August. And that's typically the worst time for Bitcoin. And we usually see into the final quarter, November particularly, we've seen spikes in the price. So it could just be a seasonal thing. We've obviously had this crazy first half of the year where we had Wall Street bets. We had this Dogecoin run-up. Bitcoin touched $65,000. NFTs were booming. It was a really exciting start to the year.
And now we've had the Bitcoin energy consumption debate resurface. We're having increased clampdowns from China now. We seem to be entering this kind of regulatory phase at the moment, which is driving prices down. But long term, I think-- you know, I think Bitcoin still has a very bullish case. We still have halvings and things like that to look forward to, which should help to prop up prices as we go forward.
ADAM SHAPIRO:
Will we be putting a fork in Dogecoin-- which I prefer to call Doggy coin. But is it about time that this has jumped the shark? What would you say about the trends we saw in the last quarter about where Dogecoin may be headed?
OLLIE LEECH:
Yeah, I mean, the big thing for Dogecoin is to be aware of the risks. And I think, you know, in the start of the first half of this year, we saw people getting really excited about it. A lot of people who may have never even engaged in the crypto space were buying Dogecoin because it was available on Robinhood. Everyone was talking about it.
But again, it has some serious underlying risks that people need to be aware of. And I think that as time goes on, and Elon Musk in particularly, he's lost a lot of favor with the crypto community. So that might be hampering prices in its potential to go back to $0.69. Yeah, it's a bit of a risky investment. And again, it doesn't really have the utility to push it forward like Ethereum, like Bitcoin, and like some other projects.
ADAM SHAPIRO:
I think we should remember Elon Musk's mother on ""Saturday Night Live,"" the television show, said to him, ""Do not [INAUDIBLE] Dogecoin."" All right, Ollie Leech, thank you so much for joining us. Ollie is the CoinDesk learn editor.

What Happened: Switzerland-based Sygnum bank announced today that it wouldallow Ethereum 2.0 (CRYPTO: ETH) staking services to its clients.
In doing so, Sygnum becomes the first bank to offer staking services to the ETH 2.0 deposit contract.
According to the announcement clients that go through Sygnums institutional-grade banking platform can earn a yield of up to 7 percent annually.
Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain protocol, and Ethereum staking is a core element for digital asset portfolios which can now be accessed in a convenient, secure, and regulated setting,said Thomas Eichenberger, head of business units at Sygnum Bank.
Why It Matters: Last week, a reportfrom JPMorgan Chaseforecasted that Ethereum 2.0 staking could generate a staking industry worth $40 billion by 2025.
Staking research platform Staking Rewardsestimates that Ethereum 2.0 is the second-largest Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network with $13.9 billion in staked value despite only 5 percentof ETHs circulating supply locked in.

The average value of staking rewards offered by ETH 2.0 stake pools is 6.14 percent,which makes Sygnums higher yield offering an attractive incentive for new staking participants.
Sygnum clients can participate in the new proof-of-stake Ethereum and benefit from potentially higher staking rewards now. This is a compelling choice for long-term investors in the Ethereum ecosystem, commented Sygnums Head of Accounts and Custody, Thomas Brunner.

DOT-USD
) begin flexing their muscles, those who havent participated in the cryptocurrency narrative may be tempted to do so given the sectors steep correction. But as decentralized projects flourish, the blockchain might also risk starting its own logical fallacy. That is, you must separate the technology from the economics of the underlying innovation.
Source: shutterstock.com/nurionstd
However, this isnt to say that Polkadot is like any other decentralized platform that originated in recent years. Instead, its a profound innovation, one that represents the rapid evolution of the blockchain space. In the beginning, there was Bitcoin (CCC:
), which proved the viability of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that could send assets of economic value across borders relatively cheaply and efficiently.
But P2P isnt the only useful application for blockchain technology. And thats where Ethereum (CCC:
ETH-USD
) comes in. Leveraging elements of Bitcoins architecture, Ethereums developers created a decentralized network which essentially replaces the human intermediary (i.e. brokers, attorneys) in contractual relationships. If Bitcoin is a single-lane highway, you might look at Ethereum and its smart contracts as a multilane highway.
However, one visit to Los Angeles or similar metropolitan area and youll find that a multilane highway just isnt enough to move traffic. Therefore, you might look at Polkadot as an expansive network of highways. As Coinmarketcap.com explains, Polkadot is a sharded multichain network meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (parachains). This parallel processing power improves scalability.
From a technical perspective, Polkadot is a thing of beauty. Through parallel action, you can eliminate the congestion that dogs other popular blockchain networks. Further, because DOT-USD is undergirded by a proof-of-stake protocol rather than proof of work (such as Bitcoin), Polkadot is much more environmentally friendly.
Ultimately, though, you must ask yourself: does any of this matter?
The Economics of Polkadot Has to Mean Something
Dont mistake the above inquiry as a slight against Polkadot. As I mentioned, DOT represents an evolution of the blockchain industrys broader trajectory. Further, you can make the argument that as such innovations materialize, this lends more credibility to cryptocurrencies.
But its also important to separate the incredible tech powering Polkadot with the market potential of DOT. I understand that its difficult to do because you would assume that a utilitarian and efficient decentralized platform will eventually do what central bankers fear: disrupt or even outright replace the current financial paradigm
For this to happen, though, the Polkadot system must incentivize the public contributors that make the network click. While a decentralized trust model is profoundly innovative, decentralization alone wont spark a viable economy. Indeed, it might even hinder it.
For starters, decentralized platforms may be trustless but that doesnt mean free. They require electricity, computing power, storage capacity and other components. In a mainstream platform, a centralized entity provides said components and enjoys the fruits of its labor. In a decentralized platform, the public provides those components and collectively enjoys the rewards.
But that brings up the second point of concern. Basically, the rewards have to be worth it for network contributors to provide whats necessary for the network to function. But if the underlying platform is too efficient, that might leave a small profit margin that wouldnt be attractive. In other words, high efficiency would mean fewer jobs for network contributors to work.
Should Polkadot fail to bring in the volume, it presumably wouldnt bode well for DOT. Its akin to the philosophical question regarding the tree falling but no one being around to hear it. Like I said, technology alone wont mean much unless people care to speculate on the underlying crypto coin.
Probably Better to Wait
With the market being the ultimate arbiter, I would wait for a better discount if you were thinking of adding Polkadot to your portfolio. Frankly, the technical posture  by technical, Im referring now to DOTs chart pattern  is ugly, as it is for other cryptos.
But once the coin reaches a stabilization point, it might be worth it to take a shot. But in my opinion, that time isnt now. Personally, Im aiming for single digits before I consider adding it to my portfolio.

How so? Since falling to around $1.14 on June 22, this altcoin has trended higher. And it may not be justa dead cat bounce. Why? As one of the top contenders to give Ethereum (CCC:
ETH-USD
) a run for its money, aka an Ethereum killer, it makes sense why crypto market participants are champing at the bit to get back into it.
Forthcoming upgrades (more below) could result in a leveling up of this platform, enabling it to speed up its user growth, and in turn, result in big appreciation for its native coin.
So, even as the crypto market faces many challenges ahead, including possible regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. government what may be the best move? The risk of a further crypto fallout may not be completely off the table. But in light of whats ahead for ADA-USD, now may be the time to start scooping up a position.
Could Cardano Be Near a Breakout?
Much has been discussed about Cardanos pending Alonzo upgrades These enhancements could help this platform gradually grab share from the still top- dog in the DeFi (decentralized finance) space, Ethereum.
7 Top-Rated REITs to Buy Today
But what if this happens much sooner? Thats the view of market analyst Nicholas Merten. As crypto publication The Daily Hodl broke it down July 5, Merten sees Cardano on the verge of another surge thanks to its upcoming integration of smart contract capability, code-named Goguen, which is set to happen next month.
In short, instead of smart contracts being another feather in its cap, helping to fuel ADA-USDs continued gradual rise, the launch of this future could help spark another breakout in its coin price. Given its upswing in recent days, its clear many agree about this scenario playing out.
This could mean nows the time to pounce, ahead of a further move towards $2 per coin once smart contract capabilities go live. Even so, still keep in mind that volatility isnt completely off the table. Being too cautious could result in missing out. Yet, its clear this still remains far from being a bet the ranch type of situation.
Possible Challenges
With the Alonzo/Goguen upgrades, Cardanos rebound could happen sooner rather than later. Or can it? This catalyst may be a possible game changer. But even with it, its far from guaranteed this altcoin will soar once smart contract capabilities go live.
For one, the crypto market overall could continue to trade sideways. This may happen if the above-mentioned regulation possibilities remain a concern. Then again, the upgrades for Cardano and Ethereum and may help to rekindle enthusiasm for digital assets overall. Instead of crypto delivering lukewarm returns in the months (and possibly years) ahead, we could see a fast move back to bull market mode.
The launch of these upgrades may be just what this market needs to get itself back on track. But the upgrades happening across the board for cryptos, including possibly for Bitcoin (CCC:
BTC-USD
), isnt all a positive for Cardano. It could be a negative as well. As its rival blockchains are also leveling up, this platform may end up seeing a much smaller increase in its usage.
On the bright side, theres one risk that may not be as big as it seemed just a few weeks back. Im talking about the fact that most of its owners have held it for less than a year.To some extent, its still a concern. But looking at Cardanos recent price action, the most fair weather of this bunch has likely bailed out by now. Those still holding it may have only entered positions in the past 12 months. If theyre still long now, theyll likely stay long, as theyre betting on this cryptos rapid ascension once its upgrades go live.
The Bottom Line
The risk of continued across-the-board declines for crypto may not be completely off the table. But with the forthcoming upgrades, the dust may have already settled on the crypto meltdown of 2021. Cryptocurrencies may continue to trade sideways in the immediate future. Yet once the above-mentioned upgrades come online, it could spark a renewed wave of enthusiasm.
In the case of Cardano, its Alonzo/Goguen upgrades may be the catalyst that starts sending it toward its high. With these upgrades just around the corner, today may be the perfect time to start accumulating a position.

)
, the tokens native to the Ethereum blockchain, was going up on Tuesday. As of 3:20 p.m. EDT today, the price had risen almost 4% over the previous 24-hour period, according to CoinDesk. While a move like this is certainly inside of what's considered normal for volatile cryptocurrencies, we can't discount a major update about a change coming to the network.
So what
At 10:40 this morning, a developer for Ethereum proposed a date for an update called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), or the London hard fork. Assuming other developers agree, the update will be scheduled to take place on Aug. 4. The main thing that EIP-1559 should bring is a change to Ethereum's fee structure.
Image source: Getty Images.
Right now, if you want to transact with Ether, you blindly bid what you're willing to pay in transaction fees, which can lead to overpaying. EIP-1559 might not reduce fees, but it will regulate them. More importantly, a certain amount of Ether will get ""burned"" with transactions, disappearing from the supply completely.
To clarify, Ether was launched with an annual limit of 18 million new tokens. So it's an inflationary cryptocurrency. The rate of inflation has gone down every year as the circulating supply has grown. But by introducing the new burn structure with EIP-1559, it's possible for Ether to become deflationary with enough transactions to offset the new supply. The move toward the London hard fork could be what's rallying investors to Ether today.
Now what
There's a lot going on with Ethereum these days besides the London hard fork. A bigger update is called Ethereum 2.0 which should make the network more scalable, handling higher volume and solving the current congestion to the blockchain. Investing in cryptocurrencieslike Ether isn't for the faint of heart because they're volatile and the price of Ether could reverse tomorrow. But I believe the London hard fork and Ethereum 2.0 are generally good developments. By solving key problems with this technology, it could make it more practical and usable long term.

After a chaotic few months for cryptocurrency the market has calmed down considerably.
For the last seven days, bitcoinhas failed to break above $36,000 or drop below $32,000  and for the last seven weeks it has traded within a $10,000 window between $30,000 and $40,000.
This remarkable period of stability has been largely mirrored by other leading cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ether) and Cardano (ada), however certain meme coins have managed to buck market trends with their own record-breaking runs.

Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs Group Incsees potential in Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) becoming a better-suited store of value than market-leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).
What Happened:In a report seen by Business Insider the bank highlighted Ethereums utility in being the smart contract platform of choice for the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications as one of the reasons why it could eventually overtake Bitcoin.
""[Ether] currently looks like the cryptocurrency with the highest real use potential as Ethereum, the platform on which it is the native digital currency, is the most popular development platform for smart contract applications,"" said the Goldman Sachs analysts in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Why It Matters: According to the analysts, Bitcoins dominance as the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, and its reputation as a store of value, comes from its stronger brand driven by its first-mover advantage.
However, Bitcoins relatively slow transaction speed and lack of real use cases puts Ethereum in a better spot to become the more dominant store of value in the realm of cryptocurrencies.
The analysts referred to both Bitcoin and Ethereum as a risk-on inflation hedge and said that comparisons to the more conventional store of value assets, like gold, werent suitable at thetime.

The latest upgrade to the ethereum network is on track for August 4, developers have said.
It will include a change to transaction fees that will start to ""burn"" or destroy ether coins.
Analysts have said the changes could help boost the ether price by limiting the supply.

.
The hotly anticipated London upgrade to the ethereum network, which will change how fees work and start to destroy ether coins, is on track to launch on August 4, developers have said.
Named the ""London hard fork"", the upgrade has already started to be rolled out on test versions of the ethereum blockchain.
But ethereum developer Tim Beiko confirmedon Wednesday that the upgrade was ready and should hit the main ethereum network, or ""mainnet"", on August 4. Beiko said people should expect an official announcement next week.
James Beck, director of content at ethereum development company ConsenSys, told Insider: ""Client teams have come to a soft consensus to initiate the London upgrade at block 12,965,000, which is expected around August 4.
He added: ""This date is an estimate depending on the number of blocks produced on ethereum between now and then.""

The London hard fork will include a major changeto the way transactions fees work on the ethereum blockchain.
Currently, users bid to have their transactions verified by miners. But under the change - technically known as ethereum improvement protocol 1559 - users will pay more predictable fees.
The most exciting part for many ether holders is that some of the so-called gas fee will be ""burned"" or destroyed after each transaction. It means the burn rate could surpass the rate at which new coins are issued, potentially boosting the price.
Investment bank Saxo said this weekthat a lower supply of ether could help the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency challenge bitcoin as a store of value.
The ethereum network is also set to undergo an even bigger overhaul, known as ethereum 2.0
Under ethereum 2.0, the blockchain will operate on a proof-of-stake system where it is secured by users putting forward an ether ""stake"" to gain the right to validate transactions and earn coins.

. Each of the lines represents one of the cryptocurrencies. All are based against the U.S. dollar. Here, Tether is the red line. The indicator is also very flexible in that cryptos can be swapped out for any that are on Tradingview. You can find more details about the indicator
here.
So when Tether is rising, the cryptocurrency market falls. And when Tether falls, the cryptocurrency market rises en masse. This is one of the major differences between the forex market and the cryptocurrency market. In forex, the currencies all move in different directions and at different speeds. For cryptocurrencies, this is not the case, so the indicator gives an instant visual picture as trends develop against Tether in all timeframes.
Bitcoin Daily Chart.
We can see on the Bitcoin daily chart that little has changed since last week in terms of the floor and ceiling of support and resistance range. Support and resistance remain within the spread of the may 19 volatility candle. However, what has changed is the intraday volatility, which has drained away to virtually nothing. This is noted by the spread of the candles narrowing, and centered on the volume point of control, which is the yellow dashed line on the chart. This is the point at which price agreement has been reached and there is an equilibrium. This currently sits at $35,000 and is confirmed by the deepest volume as shown on the histogram.
This phase of price action and the chart pattern is now a classic example of Wyckoffs second law, namely, the law of cause and effect. In other words, the greater the cause or the time a market is in congestion, the greater the effect in the resulting price action that follows. You can think of this as a clockwork toy, the more the spring is wound, the tighter it becomes as it stores more energy with every turn. Eventually, when it is fully wound and this stored energy is released, the toy travels a great distance.
In Bitcoins case, the price action is storing up energy to be released in an explosive move, as no market can remain range-bound forever. The issue, of course, is we cannot be 100% certain in which direction and this is where an option strategy could provide a solution, albeit a volatile and expensive one. The option strategy in question is the straddle, which is a directionless trade. The strategy pays off regardless of the direction of the breakout, but its not that simple, as it is all down to timing. If the market remains range-bound within the period set for the options, then premiums are lost. So it requires a volatile move for this approach to work. And, of course, its not always easy to forecast when the break is likely to occur as the options waste away.
Moving to the chart itself, if we consider the volume at the bottom, while there has been buying on each reversal lower, the issue is this has not translated into rising volume and rising prices, which is the classic effort and result we need to see. In fact, since June 21, the volume has been declining. But then this is in line with the narrowing spreads, and may well be a reflection of the summer season when volumes decline naturally.
In summary, when the explosive breakout occurs, the levels of interest for the development of the trend are described by the May 19 volatility candle with the ceiling at $43,500 and the floor at $28,500. Remember, for the breakout to be valid we need to see it accompanied by strong and rising volume. If so, given the time we have been in congestion, expect the trend to have some momentum and last for some time.

EthereumLondon hard fork is expected to launch very soon, traders move forward with guarded optimism.
EIP 1559 protocol upgrade will change the current Ether fee mechanism and monetary policy, likely to make transaction costs cheaper.
Goldman Sachs believes Ethercould overtake Bitcoin as the network becomes more scalable.
Ethereum enthusiasts are waitingfor the delayed release of the London hard fork while trading with caution. The most notable Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) in the upgrade is EIP 1559. This, combined with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is considered equivalent to a Triple Halving.
Ethereum prepares for network upgrade
The upcoming London hard fork is a critical milestonein the Ethereum roadmap leading up to the release of ETH 2.0. It will change the protocols consensus algorithm from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake and restructure the monetary policy.
Currently, transaction fees are calculated by the concept of the ""first-price auction. Market participants bid a set price for miners to process their transactions and the highest bidder wins. However, this is set to change with EIP 1559.
The network update will introduce a base fee for transactions to be included in a block. Users who wish to prioritize their transactions will have the option to add a tip or priority fee to incentivize miners for including their transactions in the next block. The higher the tip the bigger the chances for the transaction to be processed.
EIP 1559 does not directly intend to make gas cheaper. The base fee will fluctuate by up to 12.5% after blocks are more than 50% full, which makes transaction fees predictable and transparent to prevent users from overpaying for gas.
Among other changes that result from the EIP 1559 upgrade, the most notable one is that 70% of transaction fees on the Ethereum network will be burned, meaning that this supply will be deleted from circulation. The remaining 30% will be delivered to stakers as an additional staking reward, in addition to their regular issuance.
The significant drop in Ether supply is key to drive Ethereums price since it makes it a deflationary asset.
Popular Ethereum Researcher Nikhil Shamapant, mentioned in his research on EIP 1559 that
While many Ethereum bulls fully understand that EIP1559 will improve Ether as a store of value, I dont think they are modeling for the further way it affects elasticity of supply. If supply is being removed, it matters more if its being removed from HODlers who were already inelastic anyway or speculators who cant sell that Ether in the future. There is no more inelastic source of supply than nonexistent supply.
The so-called Triple Halving
Given the significance of the upcoming protocol upgrade, the concept of Ethereum Triple Halving that started as an analogy on Crypto Twitter has evolved into an analysis of financial flows to predict what will happen to the price of Ethereum by January 2023.
Post-merge, $ETHsell pressure will drop 90%. For $BTCsell pressure to reduce this much, it takes 3 halving events. Ill repeat:
ETH will undergo the equivalent of 3 halving events in the next 12 months.
 Squish (@SquishChaos)
April 17, 2021
Ethereums Triple Halving has its roots in the reduction in supply, Following a successful upgrade to EIP 1559, a drop in sell pressure is expected. Analysts believe that a 30% reduction of circulating Ether could take place, which is about half of the effect of a single Bitcoinhalving. Meanwhile, the transition to PoS might result in a supply shock equivalent to two halvings.
The much-awaited London hard fork was expected to go live this month, but after a delay, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko proposed August 4 as the potential launch date. Other key developers will make a final decision on July 9.
While the exact date of the network update remains to be decided, USmultinational investment bank Goldman Sachs is bullishon Ethereum.
[Ether] currently looks like the cryptocurrency with the highest real use potential as Ethereum, the platform on which it is the native digital currency, is the most popular development platform for smart contract applications.

"Ethereum 'London' network update delayed to August
The 'hard fork' includes five Ethereum enhancement proposals (EIP)
The long-awaited London hard fork of the Ethereum network, which includes five protocol improvement proposals, will likely launch on August 4 between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. (local time), with the block 12,965 .000. Many Ethereum enthusiasts welcome the launch delay, while some view it with ""cautious optimism.""
The event is part of the roadmap designed for the launch of Ethereum 2.0, the long-awaited renewal of the network that will replace the current proof of work protocol with the less polluting proof of stake. The London hard fork has been delayed for a few days - its implementation was expected in July - but it has already been tested in several test networks. After the successful activation in the Ropsten and Goerli 'test' environments, the definitive launch date of the 'hard fork' was decided.
The protocol update includes five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), among which EIP 1559 and EIP 3554 stand out, whose objective is to counteract various inefficiencies, CoinDesk reports:
EIP 1559 introduces a new fee structure to make Ethereum less expensive. This change in the protocol is very controversial because it aims to burn part of the tariffs and, therefore, reduce the income of the miners.
The EIP 3554 delays the Ethereum difficulty bomb until December 1. This mechanism will increase the difficulty of mining on the Ethereum network, effectively ""freezing"" the proof of work in preparation for Ethereum's move to proof of stake.
Experts point to all these improvements as a true revolution that will impact the price of ether, the native unit of the network, to the point that many believe that it will end up surpassing bitcoin.

"The Shyft Network, a platform designed to help cryptocurrency firms comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules, has launched its main public blockchain system. Combining elements of Ethereum and Bitcoin, the Shyft Network is an open base-layer platform that  houses decentralized identity applications, compliant cryptocurrency transactions and tools to make decentralized finance (DeFi) palatable to regulators, without compromising DeFis open appeal. Alongside Wednesdays mainnet launch is the unveiling of the Shyft Federation, a diverse group of 21 entities, from core crypto development teams to large financial institutions, that will run nodes on the Shyft Network and ensure it has a decentralized architecture from the get-go. Regulation of cryptocurrency is inescapable. The Shyft project helps crypto companies meet the identity and data sharing requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering group, but with the least amount of centralized trusted authority, akin to how blockchains already work. A lot of projects are taking a kind of progressive decentralisation approach, Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg said in an interview. But we are saying this needs to be hardened, ready for primetime, and come with really good censorship resistance across the infrastructure from day one. The Shyft Federation consists of 21 private Tor nodes (referring to the onion router, a layered system designed to protect privacy), run by companies, organizations and even a sovereign government (Weinberg wouldnt disclose which country) that perform a function similar to mining a blockchain. Named Federation members include CoinShares, BitFury, ChainSafe and Fabric Labs. Under the hood, Shyft runs a modified version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a kind of software rulebook that governs the changing state of the blockchain that is followed by all the nodes on the network. In the case of Shyft, a proof-of-authority consensus system is operated by the federation of nodes, with all the relaying done inside Tor to protect against things like denial-of-service attacks, Weinberg explained. In legacy finance, centralized technology such as SWIFT exists to collect counterparty information and route payments. (Blockchains were not designed to require any identity information for routing payments on-chain, which means there is no way to determine counterparty risk.) Shyfts Veriscope application, a system of smart contracts running on top of the networks base fabric, creates a counterparty discovery and coordination layer for crypto finance, Weinberg said. Veriscope is designed to satisfy the data-sharing requirements of FATFs travel rule, but without sacrificing the core pillars of decentralization and open innovation, he said. In addition to hosting the Veriscope travel rule product, the now-live Shyft mainnet, will be home to a national identity system for Bermuda built with the countrys government, and also a set of smart contracts to help regulators accept and work with DeFi. The problem encountered when throwing a lot of know your customer (KYC) at a DeFi platform is that it denatures all thats interesting about the platform, Weinberg pointed out. The moment you add KYC, you break composability, he said, referring to the idea that DeFi projects can easily build atop each other. To solve for that, Shyft offers an on-chain KYC rules engine that can be customized so that, for example, a KYC policy from one institution can be made available across many institutions at once, or pre-defined rules can be created around particular institutional liquidity pools and users can choose to opt in, Weinberg said. So we can basically start to re-architect composability, Weinberg said, adding:",2021-07-07,0.9956,0.123,0.017,0.86

"Ethereum Classic
(CRYPTO:ETC) are two cryptocurrencies that run on the Ethereum blockchain.
Ethereum Classic is the original version of Ethereum that executed smart contracts with a Proof-Of-Work platform. Ethereum later changed to a Proof-Of-Stake platform after there was a hack on the platform.
Ethereum Daily Chart Analysis
Ethereum has been trading along the higher low trendline and could breakout if it can cross above resistance.
Ethereum is trading below the 50-day moving average (green) but above the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating the crypto is likely in a period of consolidation.
The 50-day moving average may act as resistance while the 200-day moving average may hold as a support level.
Key Ethereum Levels To Watch
Ethereum has been able to hold the higher low trendline throughout the past few months;if it continues to hold this line, it may eventually see another breakout.
The crypto is showing some resistance near the $3,000 level as this area was rejected multiple times in the past.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has started to move back up once again re-crossing above the 50 level. This indicatesthere are now more buyers than sellers in Ethereum once again.
Ethereum Classic Daily Chart Analysis
The Ethereum Classic chart looks similar to the Ethereum chart as the stock was able to find support near the higher low trendline and start heading higher.
Ethereum Classic is trading below the 50-day moving average (green) but above the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating there is likely a period of consolidation happening.
The 50-day moving average may act as resistance while the 200-day moving average may hold as a support level.
Key Ethereum Classic Levels To Watch
Ethereum Classic broke below the $80 level, bounced, and then was unable to cross above the $80 level once again. Now this area may act as resistance once again.
An old resistance level of $40 later became support after the crypto was able to bounce near this level. Recently, Ethereum Classic was able to bounce near the $40 as this level and the higher low trendline were both near this area creating what technical traders might call an area of doubled support.
The RSI on Ethereum Classic has also started rising and was able to cross back above the 50 level. The RSI now sits at 51, meaning there are slightly more buyers than sellers in the crypto.

Ethereum opened June 1at a price of $2,705.72 and closed on June 30at a price of $2,276.34, showing a loss of 15.87% for the month of June.
Ethereum Classic opened June 1at a price of $70.11 and closed on June 30at a price of $57.50, showing a loss of 17.98% for the month of June.

New frontiers: Mining after The Merge
The Merge is one of two upcoming code changes on Ethereum that is expected to radically change network monetary policy and reward dynamics. It seeks to reduce the energy consumption of Ethereum by an estimated 99.95% The other, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, is aimed at improving the transparency and efficiency of Ethereums fee market.
Last week
, we discussed miners perspectives on EIP 1559. While EIP 1559 is the more imminent upgrade slated for activation on the network early next month, its impact on miner revenue and profitability is minor in comparison with The Merge upgrade, according to Igor Stadnyk, the CEO of Ethereum mining pool Mineral
Basically, the current EIP is not a huge reduction [to rewards]. A huge reduction was from five to three ether. A huge reduction was from three to two ether, Stadnyk said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.
Stadnyk is referring to changes that protocol developers have activated in the paston Ethereum to curb monetary inflation by reducing block subsidy rewards. Block subsidies are a fixed amount of ether awarded to miners for every block they successfully find and append to the blockchain. After The Merge, block subsidies will once again be reduced, only this time from 2 ETH to zero.
When theres nothing left to mine
Once Ethereum merges with the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, mining on the network will become obsolete. For miners, there will be no block subsidies, no transaction fees and certainly no miner extractable value(MEV). Revenue from transaction fees and MEV will instead be awarded to users who contribute to network security by staking their coin holdings in increments of 32 ETH.
These users, also called validator node operators, will most consistently be rewarded on Ethereum in the form of interest on their staked ether. For validator node operators actively running software on Eth 2.0 today, their estimated annual percentage return (APR) for a single 32 ETH deposit is between 6% and 7%.
For Ethereum miner Brian Lee those returns arent a convincing reason to make the switch from mining to validating post-Merge, given that he would likely have to sell some of his bitcoin holdings in order to have enough ether to stake. Lees long-term bets are on bitcoin becoming a better store for wealth than ether because of the experimental and frequently changing roadmap of Ethereum.
So Im thinking maybe Ill switch to [mining] Ethereum Classic, Lee said during a phone interview with CoinDesk. Theres a ton of coins out there. I think a lot of guys I talked to [are] thinking about going to Ravencoin after Ethereum merges.
Finding a new  As the worlds second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Ethereum is the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine on graphics processing unit (GPU) devices. These devices are also frequently used for video gaming applications. GPUs, unlike application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices that dominate the Bitcoin blockchain, can be repurposed for different tasks and computations.
Michael D. Carter, the host of cryptocurrency mining YouTube channel BitsBeTrippin told CoinDesk in a phone interview that according to his calculations if all Ethereum GPU miners were to move over to Ravencoin, the price of the coin would have to appreciate roughly 10 times in order for miners to remain profitable.
To Carters mind, the more likely scenario post-Merge is that miners end up splitting their computational energy, also called hashrate, across multiple different coins that support GPU mining and stay in business by spreading out to several new blockchain networks.
Youre going to see network discovery and youre going to get buzz around other networks naturally because people are going to want to know: Where are the miners going to be pointing their hashrate? Is there anything as profitable? Whats the value propositions of these other networks? Carter said.
And it wont just be miners doing network analysis and profitability projections post-Merge for mining alternatives to Ethereum.
Wolfgang Spraul, director of operations at Linzhi a cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturing company that builds Ethereum ASICs, told CoinDesk in an email, If nobody on Ethereum is left using Ethash-PoW, [Ethereums mining algorithm], we will work with Ethereum Classic. And if no one there wants to use Ethash-PoW any longer, we will work with smaller coins like Ubiq.
At this stage in the game with The Merge estimated by developers to be ready for activation early next year, mining pools such as 2Minerssay its too early to announce anything concrete.
Plus, Carter adds, theres still lots of work to be done on the protocol development side for The Merge; as such, the Ethereum mining community will want to keep a close eye and stay involved in the development process.
Were all investors and have aligned interests with regards to ETH succeeding, so its a bit counterintuitive to torch that to the ground [prematurely], Carter said. Lets get through [EIP 1559] and then lets get  back to The Merge.

"Cryptocurrency investors have been anticipating the release of Ethereum 2.0. The long-planned upgrade to the Ethereum network is beginning to come to fruition. In 2020, the first phase of Ethereum 2.0, also called Eth2 or Serenity, was released.However, it was announced Jul. 6 that the London hard fork would likely launch on Aug. 4. Many crypto enthusiasts are excited for the release, while some arent ready to start celebrating. What does the London hard fork tell us about when the full rollout of Ethereum 2.0 will happen?What's Ethereum 2.0?Ethereum 2.0 will use a consensus mechanism, scalability, and security. The upgraded blockchain will use a PoS (proof-of-stake) concept instead of the traditional PoW (proof-of-work).The PoW system can be energy-intensive, as miners use computer processing to solve complex mathematical puzzles to verify transactions. When miners first solve a puzzle, they add a new transaction to the record on the blockchain. They're then rewarded with crypto coins.In the PoS system, validators stake crypto to verify a transaction and propose a block based on the amount of crypto they hold and the duration theyve owned it. Then, other validators attest that they've seen the block. When there are enough confirmations, the block can be implemented into the blockchain. Validators are awarded crypto coins for the successful block propositiona process called forging or minting.Because the PoS system is more energy-efficient, its more scalable. The original Ethereum blockchain can support only 30 or so transactions per second. However, Ethereum 2.0 has promised up to 100,000 transactions per second through the use of shard chains.Cryptocurrencies environmental impact has come under fire in recent weeks. Influential investors and governments have raised the alarm on cryptos energy consumption. Ethereum 2.0 and other blockchains running the PoS concept may help take the industry into the future.How can investors begin staking Ethereum 2.0?Crypto investors who already hold Ethereum can begin staking the ETH2 tokens. Exchanges such as Coinbase created a waitlist for users to stake the new tokens. Once investors are taken off the waitlist, they can migrate their tokens to stake ETH2. However, once an amount is staked, investors can't trade, send, or sell it until the liquidity of staked ETH2 funds is enabled.As a bonus for helping secure the network, investors who stake early in ETH2 can earn up to 6 percent annually on their investment.When will Ethereum 2.0 fully launch?Despite delays, much progress has been made. The rollout will happen in three phases: the beacon change, the merge, and shard chains.Phase 0, or the beacon change, already happened in Dec. 2020. The next phase is the merging of the beacon chain into the mainnet, marking the end of the PoW system. The merge is scheduled to launch on Aug. 4 in the London hard fork.The final phase, shard chains, will mark the full realization of Ethereum 2.0.

The Migration to Token Creation Systems With Lower Transaction Fees
Tether is an interesting project and recently theres been news of the project migrating to the Ethereum network. Right now the stablecoin USDTis the seventh largest market valuation at approximately $4 billion. Interestingly, tethers represented within that market valuation are spread across multiple blockchains.
Tether is working with an exchange to perform a swap from Omni to ERC20 of part of its USDTcold wallet, Paolo Ardoino technical director of Tether explained to the public on August 5. Currently, just over half of the USDTs in existence use the Omni Layer system, and more than $1.45 billion are represented as ERC20s. Theres also a little more than $350 million worth of tether tokens between the EOSand Tron blockchains and USDTwill also appear on the Algorand network. The reason Tether is likely migrating to other chains is because the cost to send Omni-based tokens is based on the fees derived from the BTCchain. The average BTCfee is currently well above $1 and more recently touched $4-5 per transaction However, the cheaper ETHfees or the gas to send ERC20s may only be a temporary bandaid.
Theres more than $1.45 billion ERC20 issued tether on the Ethereum network.
Currently, the gas needed to push an ERC20 token is between 11-19 U.S. centsand if youre lucky maybe $0.03 to $0.05 per send. Like BTC the Ethereum network can suffer from congestion and rising gas prices. On December 4, 2017, the entire cryptocurrency community celebrated all-time price highs, but both BTCand ETHhad severe congestion difficulties. That week the Ethereum network was 
thanks to the Crypto Kitties project. Crypto Kitties are represented as non-fungible Ethereum tokens. During the second week of January 2018, the average ETHnetwork fee spiked to $3.26 per transaction.

Ethereums elevated fees were not nearly as high as
BTC
s exponential fee market that spiked well above $50 per transaction during the last week of December 2017. Dynamic fee markets that become unsustainable can essentially neuter token use cases as it becomes infeasible to send tokens that are worth less than the underlying fees to send them. After seeing a large project like Tether move from BTCto ETH its apparent that blockchains that provide both security and low network fees will prevail in the token environment.
The average ETHtransaction fee is roughly $0.12 per transaction on August 8, 2019.
Simple Ledger Protocol Tokens Using a DAG and BCHScriptability Make the System Robust, While New Ideas Could Unleash Miner Enforceable Tokens
Bitcoin Cash and the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) have the opportunity to strive where other chains lack when it comes to delivering strong token creation. SLP tokens are robust because actions are all recorded onchain, SLP uses the BCHnetworks scriptability, and the protocol uses a directed acyclic graph(DAG) for lite proofs. Other types of colored coin concepts utilize balance-based ideas, but these require a full node for the most optimal verification. SLPs DAG is easy to implement into Simplified Payment Verification (SPV, a method for validating transactions included in a block without downloading the entire blockchain) and one can prove the legitimacy of token transactions with ease. Just like ERC20 tokens, SLP creations can be traditional fungible type 1 coins and people can also design non-fungible tokens (NFT1)using the Simple Ledger Protocol as well. In the future, SLP tokens could even be stronger by bringing the full BCHsecurity model to tokens.
The Simple Ledger Protocol has become extremely popular over the last year and so far more than 2,700 token creations have been issued using the SLP system.",2021-07-07,0.9959,0.124,0.029,0.847

The worlds largest altcoins blockchain is apparently suffering from a case of network saturation. Last week, Vitalik Buterin had stated that the Ethereum blockchain was getting full, adding that the consequences leading up to this situation would be higher transaction fees, something which may breach the affordability factor (make it expensive, basically) for some users.
Source: Etherscan.io
Now, according to recent data from etherscan.io, it can be observed that Ethereums network utilization was up to 93.72 percent on 26 August. As mentioned earlier, the increased utilization could drive up transaction cost and make users reluctant to use Ethereums blockchain. However, this isnt the first time Ethereum has faced such a dilemma.
During the massive bull run of December 2017, Ethereum faced a similar congestion issue on its network, one spearheaded by the digital game called CryptoKitties. The present network saturation is however, reportedly caused by the largest stablecoin in the market: Tether.
According to ethgasstation.info, Tether has processed transactions worth around $269,000 on ETHs ledger, which was about 18 times more than CryptoKitties back in 2017. It was also reported that Tether was presently responsible for more than 40% of all traffic on Ethereums network, as projected by John Griffin, Professor of Finance at the University of Texas at Austin.
The present issue with Tethers network utilization is the fact that other developers have access to lower and lower space on the network. Ethereum has been famously labeled in the past as a better form of Bitcoin, but the current scenario could impact Ethereums popularity.
Jeff Dorman, CIO at Arca, recently opined on the matter and stated,
So the biggest implication today is simply that developers may be incentivized to wait until this transition happens before fully committing to build on Ethereum. Tether isnt helping.

"Deflationary Ethereum EIP-1559 Upgrade Slated for Aug 4 Deployment
Read full article
July 6, 2021, 10:12 PM

2 min read
The highly anticipated London upgrade for the Ethereum network will launch on Aug. 4 according to the lead developer.
Ethereum lead developer Tim Beiko posted a block activation proposal on Githubon July 6 revealing that the mainnet upgrade is set to deploy at block 12,965,000.
This works out as an estimated date of Aug. 4 for the London hard fork, not mid-to-late July as previously expected The target will become official if the various Ethereum client teams agree to the proposal.
Developers are monitoring the testnets to see how the upgrades perform before deciding on a mainnet launch time frame. Beiko tweetedconfirmation:
Yep, unless someone objects in the next 24h, London should land on August 4th. A few client teams have okd it already, but we want to be sure no one has a serious objection.
The first blockwas produced on the Ropsten testnet on June 24 as reported by BeInCrypto. The Goerli testnet deployed the hard fork on June 30 and the final Rinkeby testnet launch is due today.
Burning the Ether
The London upgrade has been named after the second-annual Ethereum developers conference in 2015. It is designed to take the network into a deflationary state but will not necessarily reduce gas fees through the EIP-1559 update.
What it does do is adjust the auction mechanism for the fee calculation structure and burns a portion of the transaction fees. Over time this will make the asset deflationary, a process that will accelerate once mining ceases and proof-of-stake becomes the primary consensus mechanism sometime next year.
A website has been set up to watch this in actionon the Ropsten testnet. Since the code had been deployed on other testnets after a successful launch on Ropsten, it is no longer that active. However, during the short testing period, it did burn 89,148 ETH worth around $208 million at current prices.
The Goerli testnet has seen 79 ETH burnt and the Rinkeby testnet is set to launch at some time on July 7.

Ethereum software solutions firm ConsenSys has estimated that the annual supply will be reduced by 1.4%.
Ethereum price outlook 
At the time of press, ETH was changing hands for $2,340 according to CoinGecko The asset had gained 1.7% on the day adding to an overall 8% increase over the past week.
Over the past fortnight, Ethereum has recovered 25% following a slump to below $1,800 on June 26. Its next target on the upside is resistance at $2,400.

Ether (ETH) could rise by almost 40% against Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming trading sessions, according to one analyst. So believes Michal van de Poppe, an Amsterdam-based market analyst who predicts that the ETH/BTC exchange rate will climb from its current 0.050.06 BTC range to as high as 0.07 BTC soon.
The technical chartist based his bullish analogy on the pair's support level at 0.063 BTC. The price floor was instrumental in maintaining ETH/BTC's bullish bias during the mid-May 2021 notorious crypto market crash. It also served as solid support during the pair's uptrend in the early May 2020 trading session.
The bullish analogy appeared right as ETH/BTC stretched its price rebound, from its June 27 low of 0.0552 BTC, by 21.28%. It showed that more traders preferred to sell their Bitcoin holdings to seek opportunities in the Ether market in recent days. On a year-to-date timeframe, the second-largest cryptocurrency had already surged by more than 160% against Bitcoin.
The transition took cues from the euphoria surrounding Ethereum's planned consensus layer transition from its energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) to a more scalable and cheaper proof-of-stake (PoS). The project launched the first phase, called Phase 0 or Beacon Chain, in December 2020. It introduced a so-called sharded network architecture to the Ethereum blockchain
The next phase that brings Ethereum closer to PoS is the Ethereum improvement Proposal 1559, also known as the London hard fork. The upgrade proposes to replace Ethereum'sfirst-price auction fee model with a base network fee, modifiable per the network's demand. It hopes to solve the blockchain's higher gas and transaction fee problem. It also aims to make ETH a deflationary token by burning the base network fee.
Ethereum price can gain 40% on Bitcoin, argues analyst as London fork nears, Cointelegraph, Jul 7

New Delhi: Major Cryptocurrenciesposted steady gains on Wednesday as the crypto market shrugged off the fear of Beijing's regulatory crackdown. The digital token market showed a sharp recovery from previous days lows. Seven of top 10 digital tokens were trading higher at 9.30 hours IST, gaining as much as 8 per cent
China's central bank warned companies on Tuesday against assisting cryptocurrency-related businesses as it shut down a software firm over suspected involvement in digital currency transactions.
Bitcoin
has fluctuated the previous day after Chinas central bank and a regulator in the capital city took action against a company that was allegedly providing cryptocurrency-related services. However, the numero uno digital token made a swift recovery.
""The past 24 hours witnessed a steady rally across several altcoins. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum shot up more than 4 per cent after facing severe selling pressure earlier in the day. Polkadotshot up more than 7 per cent,"" Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex
""The situation was a bit different for Bitcoin, which continued to remain under steady selling pressure throughout the day. The momentum in the markets is not bullish at the moment. However, the higher traded volumes indicated that we might shortly witness the markets moving out of the consolidation phase.""
Indian banks and cryptocurrency exchanges continue their love-hate relationship. Crypto exchange Zebpay has found an innovative way to draw investors. It has decided to pay interest on cryptos that investors keep in their wallets.

Bitcoin has been pretty range-bound over the past few days. The asset has been trading in the $32,500- $36,500 range. The Bitcoin taproot upgrade is due soon, and while the impact of that of the same prices remains to be seen, this development is likely to have a positive impact on the asset.
Volumes have held up well, and the activity across the network is also good. Bitcoin remains the favourite, as the crypto markets ride the recovery trend. BTC post making the low of $28,800 has shown good signs of recovery and has started moving upwards.
Technically, on the four-hour time frame, the asset is trading in an Ascending Triangle pattern, where the prices are taking support at the rising trendline. BTC is facing stiff resistance around $36,000 to $36,500. Hence, to further rally the asset needs to trade and close above $36,500.

In a move that could compromise ethereums long-held dominance as the worlds top platform for smart-contract development, blockchain interoperability project Cosmos will offer users the choice to code in at least three different programming languages.
The first language to be supported on Cosmos is called Ethermint a direct replica of ethereums smart contract language Solidity. Aimed at making it easier for ethereum developers to port their applications to the Cosmos network, the Ethermint project has been in the works since as early as 2016, said Zaki Manian of Tendermint, the company that built Cosmos.
The second coding language, called Secure EcmaScript (SES), is a version of JavaScript built for secure smart contract deployment by blockchain startup Agoric Once the native Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is fleshed out, the Agoric blockchain and its SES programming language will be easily accessible to Cosmos users, said Agoric CEO Dean Tribble.
Last but not least, JP Morgan blockchain spin-off Kadena announced Tuesday it too would be building a version of its native smart-contract language, PACT, for the Cosmos ecosystem. Its entrant to the Cosmos coding arms race is called Kadenamint.
Were committing to getting an industry-level smart contract language on [Cosmos] to give developers more deployment choices, Kadena founder Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk.
According to Popejoy, the comparative strengths of Kadenamint outperform that of Ethermint in every way.
We see PACT as the standard for smart contract languages because PACT is just better than Solidity, Popejoy said, adding:
Every single developer that comes to use it get things done faster. Its safer. We have formal verification baked into the language. Its designed for safety.
In all fairness, ethereum developers are well aware of the limitations of Solidity and the virtual machine built to execute Soliditys code. Called eWASM the next major ethereum upgrade dubbed ethereum 2.0 will replace ethereums virtual machine and enable developers to code in multiple different programming languages.
Even so, Popejoy remained skeptical about eWASM and ethereum 2.0 saying the criticisms of ethereums virtual machine and Solidity could have been addressed a long time ago but werent  due to poor leadership.
I wouldnt consider them competitors but as it is, I consider them legacy, said Popejoy about ethereum. They did a good job in getting smart contracts out there and getting people thinking about it but thats going to be a footnote.
New competition
The new competitors differ from Solidity by placing a stronger emphasis on security as opposed to immutability and unstoppability.
Were building a platform with a security model that normal developers can understand, said Agorics Tribble. To us, the biggest problem with ethereum and Solidity is they have the wrong security model. Even security experts cant get it right.
Unlike Solidity, both PACT and SES employ an object-capability security model This means that permissions in a smart contract can be dynamically and rapidly updated to give users access to different parts of application data in a safe way.
Tribble describes the model similar to being able to give your car keys over to a valet without also handing over the rights to car ownership.
Said Tribble:
Thats typical of identity-based access control where the model of security used is such that the authority that Im able to give you is either too much or too little. Its not appropriate for the business interaction were trying to have.
In Tribbles view, porting object-capability security to smart contracts is the kind of innovation that will signal to the rest of the mainstream developer community that the blockchain industry is ready for mass adoption.
For mainstream folks, having people that are addressing different parts of the market and visibly overlapping as competitors is actually healthy, said Tribble. That means theres a real market.
From the perspective of Manian, Cosmos is the ecosystem that can support and host this fast-growing market for smart contracts and decentralized application development. At the same time, he warns that in his view, Cosmos will not and simply cannot replace ethereum entirely because ethereum is much more than a technology.
Ethereum is so much more than software. Ethereum, the ethereum community, the users of the ethereum blockchain, the faith people have in the core developers. All of that is wrapped up into one thing and that is the ethereum user experience, Manian said, adding:
Were just creating new developer possibilities.

After a rough quarter, cryptocurrencies are on the rise again
The UK's financial regulator recently imposed a ban on Binance, the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange. This comes in the middle of a global scepticism about the regulatory ambiguity of cryptocurrencies.
Ira Puranik
/ 09:32 PM IST
Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has seen high volatility this year.
After losing market favour post a bloody quarter, the market for cryptocurrencies seems to be warming up again. In what can only be described as a 'bear market' for the crypto space, the last quarter seemingly brought to halt the euphoria around the alternative currencies, which are currently valued at halved values from their all-time highs.
Consider this. A CoinDesk quarterly review of the market notes that Bitcoin, which is trading at around $32,600, almost 49 percent down from its all-time high of $64,863 in April 2021.  The same stands true for Ethereum, which is down by as much as 50 percent from its all-time May high of $4,300. However, Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain platform, managed to end the quarter in green with almost 18 percent growth along with XRP, which managed to rise about 21 percent.
Bearish Sentiment
Ask any market expert and theyll tell you that course corrections are a needed exercise. The current prices, a reflection of the same, paint a bleak picture, with Bitcoin down almost 5 percent and Ethereum following suit with an 8 percent fall over the last 24 hours.
It's hard to discount the clear impact of all the developments that happened over the last quarter on the current prices of these assets. With China intensifying its crackdown on cryptocurrency mining by shutting crypto-mines in energy-intensive regions of Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Qinghai, in addition to issuing warnings to banks and payment giants to halt transactions related to cryptocurrencies, miners have been looking beyond the country, traditionally the biggest crypto mining giant in the world and exploring alternatives in countries like the US, Canada, Kazakhstan and more.",2021-07-08,0.8894,0.075,0.045,0.88

"So what
Why is that? Well, the most obvious answer appears to be government regulation.
In the United Kingdom for example, regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority have ordered Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, to post a notice on its website advising that ""it is not authorized to operate in the U.K.,"" reports CNBC today. The news agency further notes that ""customers were temporarily unable to make card withdrawals due to an issue with the U.K.'s Faster Payments system,"" which one would expect to make traders nervous about holding their cryptocurrency. Furthermore, local bank Barclays ""has blocked customers from sending payments to the crypto exchange.""
Nor are U.K. regulators the only ones meddling in the cryptocurrency market. China's aversion to crypto is by now well known And even in the United States, high profile Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who chairs the Senate's Subcommittee on Economic Policy, has commented that she wants to see ""common-sense regulations"" of cryptocurrency in the U.S. Worrying that the erratic swings in the prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum will ""end badly"" for traders, she has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to ""use its full authority"" to regulate the market, and wants to hear how they plan to do it by July 28.
Now what
Long story short, while tightened regulation of cryptocurrency in the U.S. hasn't happened yet, there's now a firm date on the horizon -- less than three weeks from now -- when new regulations may be proposed.
Knowing that regulation is coming, but not yet knowing just what form it will take, has to make cryptocurrency traders at least a little bit nervous, and that nervousness is showing up in the prices of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereumtoday.

Uniswap token is an ERC-20 token, meaning that it uses Ethereums blockchain to process transactions instead of having its own network. Many cryptocurrencies use Ethereums blockchain, including most non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The main advantage of Ethereum over Bitcoin is its smart contract technology. Smart contractsenable developers to make valuable protocols on Ethereums blockchain, such as Uniswap.
Uniswap Smart Contracts
Essentially, Uniswap is just a bunch of smart contracts that work together to make a decentralized exchange. Smart contracts are code thats uploaded to the blockchain, and since its on the blockchain, the code has the same immutible, decentralized and borderless capabilities that cryptocurrencies have. Smart contracts are capable of transferring money autonomously based on the parameters in the code, allowing for extremely efficient financial services.
Lets take a look at how a Uniswap smart contract works. Investors send their cryptocurrency funds to a Uniswap smart contract to earn interest on their holdings; these investors are referred to as liquidity providers and the smart contracts that hold their cryptocurrency are called liquidity pools. Liquidity providers are necessary for Uniswap to operate, as its how theyre able to provide liquidity to trade on the platform.
Instead of order books, the smart contract calculates the price of each crypto asset. Since each liquidity pool has an equal value of each crypto asset, say Ethereum and DAI, the code calculates the price of each asset using the constant product formula X*Y=K, where K is the total amount of funds in the pool and X and Y are the amount of cryptocurrency tokens in the liquidity pool. These liquidity pools will readjust their token holdings continuously in order to preserve a 50-50 balance of each asset in the liquidity pool.
Advantages of Decentralized Exchanges
There are many benefits of using Uniswap over traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors who use Uniswap can swap their cryptocurrencies directly from their Ethereum wallets, so theres no need for the exchange to have custody over their funds. This significantly lowers the risk of being hacked, adding a layer of security that centralized exchanges cant achieve. Moreover, investors dont need to make an account to use Uniswap, allowing them to trade cryptocurrencies anonymously.
Since Uniswap is decentralized, no single entity controls the exchange. After popular stock brokerages like Robinhood and WeBull halted trading of Gamestop (GME) after its recent price surge, more attention has been paid to Uniswap, as nobody can halt the trading of assets, as no one company controls the exchange.
Unbeknownst to most investors, there are ways to trade many different assets on Uniswap. Ethereum projects that have tokenized precious metals like gold and silver are available on Uniswap, and Mirror Protocol tokenizes stocks like Apple, Tesla and Google that can be traded on DEXs.
Providing Liquidity on Uniswap
Investors can choose to stake their Ethereum tokens on Uniswap to earn interest on their investment. Ethereum tokens include Ether, Ethereums native token, but it also includes ERC-20 tokens, such as Uniswap, DAI, Wrapped Bitcoin and ChainLink When investors provide liquidity on Uniswap V2, they need to provide equal amounts of Ether tokens and an ERC-20 token to enter the liquidity pool. However, with concentrated liquidity in Uniswap V3, users can deposit unequal amounts of 2 crypto assets.
To keep an equal value of each crypto asset, the smart contract rebalances the amount of Ethereum tokens and ERC-20 tokens in the liquidity pool when the price of one of the tokens changes. Albeit a small difference, if one token goes up while the other stays the same then youd be better off just holding each token separately  a concept known as impermanent loss.
As of May 5th, Uniswap launched UNI V3. The biggest upgrade in Uniswap V3 is called concentrated liquidity, and Uniswap has the exclusive rights to use this function for the next 2 years, giving them a large advantage over its competitors. Concentrated liquidity uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to let investors set a specified range of prices to provide liquidity in.
For example, an investor can concentrate their liquidity so their funds are only used in the ETH-DAI pool for when Ethereum tokens are between $1500 and $2500. Uniswap V2 liquidity providers have to cover all price ranges from $0 to infinity, which isnt an efficient allocation of their staked funds. This is especially the case for stablecoins, as stablecoins rarely move more than 1% in either direction before returning to their average price of $1.
Uniswap expects that investors can earn much more interest by providing concentrated liquidity, and you can see the interest rates you can earn on Uniswap V2 compared to Uniswap V3 on
Uniswaps website.
Is Uniswap Safe?
Uniswaps exchange is regarded as one of the most secure ways to exchange cryptocurrencies. Since Uniswap interacts directly with your Ethereum wallet, a hacker would need to breach your crypto wallet, as your funds arent held by the exchange. Since centralized exchanges hold custody of your cryptocurrency, theyre much larger targets for cryptocurrency hackers. If a hacker can breach an exchanges security, theyd be able to access a much larger pool of funds than if they were to hack any individual cryptocurrency wallet.
In regards to UNI token, theres an inherent risk of losing money just like any other investment. Cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, are high risk investments. This being said, early investors in Uniswap have seen huge returns on their investment.
Some speculators argue that Uniswap is still undervalued, as they only have about 12 employees, yet the company has similar transaction volumes to Coinbase. Uniswaps market capitalization is sitting at $16.7 billion, while Coinbase has a market cap of over $60 billion. Of course, there is more than just transaction volume that affects the valuation of these exchanges, but its an interesting statistic nonetheless.
Where to Invest in Uniswap
The 2 most popular centralized exchanges that support Uniswap token are Binanceand Coinbase Making an account with either of these exchanges is an easy process; you just need to enter your email address and create a password. Once youve made an account, youll need to verify your identity. Exchanges typically require you to provide a photo of your drivers license, your Social Security number, home address and date of birth.
Alternatively, you can use Uniswaps exchange to invest in UNI token. To use the platform, all you need to do is connect your ",2021-07-08,0.998,0.114,0.024,0.863

Shares of financial technology company Square (NYSE: SQ) fell as much as 5.7% in trading on Wednesday as growth stocks took a hit across the market.  There isn't any big, market-moving news from Square today, but the stock is getting caught up in a sell-off of growth stocks.  With the S&P 500 down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.4%, it's no surprise that Square's stock is down even more than that.

The crypto market is suffering a small crash, which has dragged down all of the biggest currencies.
Bitcoin
fell 6.55 per cent over the day, and ethereumwas down more than 10 per cent. Other smaller currencies such as dogecoinwere hit even harder  the meme crypto lost more than 10 per cent over the day.
In total, the market had fallen 6.34 per cent at the time of publication, according to tracking website CoinMarketCap. Volume also increased, presumably as holders looked to sell their currencies ahead of any possible larger slide.
>> Follow our live coverage of the cryptocurrency market.
That meant that the crypto market had lost $100 billion in the flash crash, which began overnight UK time.
The fall came amid increasing concern about a regulatory crackdown on digital currencies, particularly in China. Regulators in the country have stressed once more that they do not look favourably on crypto, and that it could face more legal scrutiny.
The latest warning came as the Chinese central bank shut down a Beijing-based software firm over suspected cryptocurrencytransactions.
The Peoples Bank of China warned that financial and payment institutions in the country are banned from involvement in cryptocurrencies.
It reiterated that it would be working to prevent and control the risk of speculation in virtual currency transactions, and protect the safety of the publics assets.
While the country has taken a dim view of cryptocurrencies generally for some time, authorities have in recent weeks stepped up their threats of further regulation and scrutiny.
That has led to a series of crashes, which have often seen significant losses. China accounts for a considerable amount of the cryptocurrency market, and miners in the country are a large part of the infrastructure underpinning digital currencies.

"retested strong resistance at 2300/2350shorts needed stops above 2400.
Todays Analysis
Bitcoin shorts at very strong resistance at 35500/36000 target minor support at 33500/33000. We bottomed exactly here this week. A break below 32500 this week sees 31700/500 before a retest of 29000/28500.
A double bottom here would help to turn the medium term outlook positive, although this is looking increasingly unlikely now. Watch for support at 27500/27000 on any further losses.
Strong resistance at 35500/36000 has held but a break above 36500 is a short term buy signal targeting 38600 and 40000/41000, perhaps as far as resistance at 42400/800.
Ripple shorts at strong resistance at 0.7100/7300 worked perfectly as we finally target 0.6660/0.6560 and 0.6340/6260. A break below 0.6200 then targets 0.6000/5900 before a retest of 0.5200/5100. The 2019 high is at 0.4940. A break below here is catastrophic for bulls and risks a slide to 0.4400/4350.
Strong resistance at 0.6670/0.6770. A break higher can target strong resistance at 0.7300/0.7400. Shorts need stops above 0.7450. A break higher can target 0.7800, perhaps as far as 0.8000/8100.
Ethereum outlook is negative as we hold strong resistance at 2300/2350shorts need stops above 2400. A break higher is a buy signal targeting strong resistance at 2600/2650. Bulls then need a break above 2700 for a longer term buy signal.
Holding strong resistance at 2300/2350 re-targets first support at 2200/2150 (hit as I write this morning). A break below here is a sell signal targeting 1950 and probably 61.8% Fibonacci support at 1728.

), which isnt a surprise.
The fund now holds 4.26% of its assets in ADA, with the next largest basket being Bitcoin Cash (CCC:
BCH-USD
) at 1.03%.
Grayscales adoption of Cardano will inevitably lead to increased public adoption. People feel more comfortable investing in something if they arent alone in their investment.
Cardano + Nexo
Nexo, a leading centralized crypto lending institution, has partnered with Cardanos team Input-Output Honk Kong (IOHK), to introduce ADA to the Nexo environment.
Thanks to this collaboration, Nexo customers will now be able to buy and sell ADA, as well as gain interest on their ADA balance or take out collateralized loans against the value of their ADA.
Nexo is very selective about which cryptos it adds to its platform, and ADA is only the second crypto that has been onboarded as a result of its new integrations system.
We see this partnership helping Cardano gain more mainstream adoption. As Nexos existing userbase, if they havent heard of it yet, will now be introduced to Cardano. And with the ability to earn 8% on their holdings, individuals have an incentive to trade for and hold ADA coin.
But Cardanos growth in usability as a financial asset is just one piece of the puzzle.
General Investor Interest in ADA Coin
Cardano also finds itself among the top coins individual investors are pouring money into.
For example, ADA ranks among crypto trader and analyst Lark Daviss top four coinsalongside Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polygon. Davis is particularly bullish on the grounds that Cardano will be gaining smart contract capabilities in the coming months.
Another crypto analyst reportedly dumped all his Ethereum to buy more Cardano The pseudonymous Capo broadcasted his decision to ditch ETH in favor of ADA to his more than 135,000 followers on Twitter.
Even the largest international crypto platform is seeing a shift from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Cardano. On eToro, ADA recently eclipsed both BTC and ETHto become the most held crypto amongst the platforms investors.
On top of this, Cardano recently saw a record level of staked ADA  $31 billion What is staking, exactly?
Well, when investors stake a crypto, theyre essentially agreeing to lock up their crypto for some amount of time to earn interest on their assets. Investors dont stake cryptos they may want to trade on a moments notice. Thus, staking implies some level of long-term confidence.
If that wasnt enough proof that ADA popularity was trending significantly upward, even a U.S, congressman has begun investing in Cardano
More Cardano Projects and Functionality
Cardano already has a presence in Africa But that presence could be expanding  not soon, it seems, but eventually.
Back in June, Cardano developers met with local governments in Ethiopia and Tanzania to discuss a collaboration. Many of these details have yet to be revealed, and the project is only in the research phase, but what has been announced is that the deal will relate to
payments and open finance.
If you need proof that Cardanos team is actively working as hard as they can to pump out deal after deal, and to improve the blockchain, just look at how active their code repository is
In early June, CryptoDiffer reported that Cardano was the most actively developed cryptoin terms of average daily development activity. This is reassuring to see, as Cardano needs proof of active development if it wants continued support pre-smart contract release.
Further, Cardanos community-led Project Catalyst
recently funded 56 proposals
, with each proposal being funded by anywhere from $5,000 to $35,000. Some of these projects focus on improving the Cardano ecosystem by upgrading existing functionality or dealing with NFTs, while others will focus on Cardanos presence in Africa.
Cardanos CEO, Charles Hoskinson, has hinted at a Cardano-based, algorithmic stablecoin This could mean great things for the ecosystem. Rather than solely encouraging holding, stablecoins namesake stability makes them better candidates for the payment of goods and services.
The Bottom Line on Cardano (ADA) Coin
Recent positive press is already improving awareness of Cardano and widespread adoption, and theres certainly more good news to come.
Especially as the release of Cardano smart contract functionality gets closer  toward the end of Summer we expect to see even more attention directed toward this leading altcoin.

pay attractive interest rateson bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and other leading tokens. Like regular banks, these companies make money by lending assets to customers at a higher interest rate than they pay. Let's dive into a few different crypto assets and their interest rates to determine which one may be best for you.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Ethereum: Bold, dynamic, but very risky
Bitcoin tends to garner the spotlight when it comes to cryptocurrency discussions, but the real star over the last year or two has been Ethereum. Despite being down over 50% from its high, Ethereum is still up 190% year to date and over 800% over the past year.
Data by YCharts
Ethereum has gained recognition for its versatility. For example, several well-known alternative coinslike Chainlink and Polygon are hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. Most non-fungible tokens(NFTs) operate on Ethereum's blockchain as well. An NFT represents digital ownership of an asset, whether it's a piece of art, a title to a car or house, or an NBA Top Shot moment.
In this way, Ethereum's blockchain is similar to a smartphone in that it can host many different applications that serve different purposes. One of the most exciting use cases of Ethereum is for smart contracts. Contract law can be very complicated. A smart contract, hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, enables two willing parties to enter into an agreement that automatically executes based on the outcome of customized conditions. The advantages are immense. As a 2018 Harvard Law School paper puts it, ""Human intervention, including through a trusted escrow holder or even the judicial system, is not required once the smart contract has been deployed and is operational, thereby reducing the execution and enforcement costs of the contracting process.""
Sergey Nazarov, the founder of Chainlink, used the example of crop insurance to describe the use of a smart contract. To paraphrase, crop insurance can be purchased by a farmer in case of a drought, flood, or another circumstance that prevents crop yield. A smart contract could be written that automatically pays a predetermined amount of insurance based on a fixed set of risk factors. The advantages are that there's no need for payment middlemen, a legal authority, or other entities gumming up the process. In theory, its simplicity would make the contract more transparent, more accessible, and cheaper by cutting out third parties.
Entities like BlockFi pay up to a 4% annual percentage yield (APY), distributed monthly, on Ethereum. Coinbase pays 0% APY on Ethereum, but it does offer 5% APY if a customer chooses to stake their Ethereum tokens. Ethereum is transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which could help the token's governance and shrink its environmental footprint. Staking prevents a user from trading Ethereum until this process is complete.
2. Bitcoin: Established, simple, but still risky
Bitcoin is far less dynamic than Ethereum -- its simplicity is what makes it so attractive. A limited supply and a network that has proved its stabilitydespite numerous hacking attempts have helped bitcoin garner international recognition. Bitcoin is far too volatile to be considered a viable currency, but its use cases as a commodity, particularly as a store of value, are becoming clear.
Contrary to popular belief, bitcoin doesn't have to replace fiat currencies to become successful Rather, it can be a globally recognized vehicle that provides value in cases of economic instability. Think hyperinflation, government coups, or a lack of safe and secure banks. Bitcoin's benefits aren't as practical in the U.S., because we have the U.S. dollar -- the world's de facto fiat currency. But elsewhere, there's a need to store value in a place that is safe from disruption.
As the largest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin tends to pay lower interest rates than other coins. Coinbase currently does not pay interest on bitcoin, but BlockFi offers an APY of up to 4%, and Gemini pays a little over 2% interest.
3. Stablecoins: A riskier version of a savings account
Unlike bitcoin and Ethereum, stablecoins represent tokenized versions of the U.S. dollar. They are meant to trade at an unwavering $1 per token, meaning they lack the upside that Ethereum and bitcoin have to offer. Two leading stablecoins, USD Coin

"Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believes Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain, could become the dominant digital store of value in the cryptocurrency sphere.
In a note to clients (
h/t BI
) on Tuesday, the Wall Street banking giant said that Ethereums smart contract decentralized manner and its utility in being the platform of choice for the majority of De-Fi (decentralized finance) protocols, give it the potential to overtake Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in the coming years.
According to Goldman, BTCs perception as the dominant digital store of valued comes from the coins stronger brand which is driven by its first-mover advantage. However, the note suggests that when compared to Ether Bitcoin  the crypto held about 90% of the crypto market value in 2013  lags in block time speeds, transaction speeds and level of functionality.
In its note, Goldman also referred to both cryptocurrencies as a risk-on inflation hedge and argued that gold is a superior store of value to digital assets.
Gold is competing with crypto to the same extent it is competing with other risky assets such as equities and cyclical commodities. We view gold as a defensive inflation hedge and crypto as a risk-on inflation hedge, the note said, while highlighting the fact that this rivalry among cryptocurrencies is another risk factor that prevents them from becoming safe-haven assets at this stage.

have had a rollercoaster of a year so far. Over the past 12 months, Bitcoin's price has surged by nearly 300%, and Ethereum is up by more than 900% -- and that's despite the massive downturn they've both experienced over the past few weeks.
Now that cryptocurrency prices are falling, it can be a smart opportunity to ""buy the dip"" and invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum while they're more affordable. But if you have limited funds available to invest, which cryptocurrency will give you more for your money? Here's what you need to know.
Image source: Getty Images.
The case for Bitcoin
Bitcoin is one of the original cryptocurrencies, and it has, by far, the most name recognition among the public.
If any cryptocurrency is going to succeed, it's going to need to earn widespread adoption among sellers. Because Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency, it already has an advantage in that department. More than 15,000 companies worldwide accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, according to Fundera, and the more merchants adopt Bitcoin, the better chance it has at becoming a mainstream form of payment.
In addition, Bitcoin is known as a deflationary currency, meaning it should only increase in value over time. This could give it a leg up over fiat currencies -- such as the U.S. dollar -- that are subject to inflation.
The major risks involved
The biggest risk involved in any cryptocurrency is that it's highly speculative at this point. While thousands of businesses do accept Bitcoin, the vast majority of sellers are not on board with cryptocurrency yet. Right now, it's anyone's guess whether Bitcoin will eventually become widely accepted. And if it doesn't become mainstream, it could eventually become worthless.
Another downside to Bitcoin is its energy consumption The Bitcoin mining process uses an incredible amount of computing power, which is an energy-intensive process. In fact, Bitcoin transactions currently consume more energy than the entire country of Venezuela, according to a study from the University of Cambridge.
That energy usage is already causing concern among regulators and investors, and Tesla recently announced it was suspending Bitcoin as a form of payment because of its energy consumption.
Image source: Getty Images.
The case for Ethereum
Ethereum is a blockchain technology that hosts a native coin called Ether. Ethereum is one of the biggest names in the blockchain space, and there is a wide variety of projects hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.
Decentralized finance
, for example, uses the Ethereum blockchain, and so do non-fungible tokens(NFTs). Ethereum is an open-source technology that allows developers from all over the world to create new applications on the blockchain, and if any of those new projects succeed, Ethereum (and Ether) will benefit from it as well.
Developers can also create ""smart contracts"" on the network, which allow users to perform safe and credible transactions without help from a third party, such as a lawyer. Smart contracts could revolutionize a variety of industries, giving Ethereum an advantage over its competitors.
Finally, developers are working on an update to the Ethereum blockchain to make it far more energy-efficient. The new technology, Ethereum 2.0 will be released later this year and is expected to use 99.95% less energy than the current technology.
The major risks involved
Again, cryptocurrencies are highly speculative, so there's no guarantee that Ethereum or Ether will become widely adopted. Ethereum also doesn't have as much name recognition as Bitcoin, so if merchants only accept one form of cryptocurrency, they may be more likely to accept Bitcoin than Ether.
Similarly, there are no promises that blockchain will be as revolutionary as some people may believe. Because Ethereum's biggest advantages lie in its blockchain technology, if blockchain itself doesn't pan out, Ethereum could suffer for it.
Which one should you choose?
Cryptocurrency in general is a high-risk investment, so before you invest at all, make sure you're willing to tolerate the high levels of risk and volatility.
While neither of these cryptocurrencies is necessarily a ""safe"" investment, Bitcoin may carry less risk than Ethereum because it has a longer track record and greater name recognition. However, Ethereum may have more opportunities for growth over time.
Whichever option you choose, make sure you've done your research and are comfortable with risk. Cryptocurrency isn't right for everyone, but choosing the right investment can help you make the most of your money.

The chart shows that BCD came to market with great fanfare in late 2017 when the price peaked at $94.22. But the tokens price collapsed.
While BCD made a higher low of $10.42 on May 7, 2021, it was just over the $2 level on July 6 and has slipped a bit lower since. BCD is a mid-cap cryptocurrency that has performed more like coal than a diamond since the November 2017 high.
Flow is 89
th
in the crypto hit parade
Flow (FLOW) is a blockchain designed for extensive scaling without the use of sharding techniques. Sharding is a database partitioning technique used by blockchain companies to enhance scalability that enables increased transaction processing.
Sharding reduces the latency or slowness of a network since it splits a blockchain network into separate shards. FLOW assists apps like NFT marketplaces and crypto-infused video games. FLOWs websiteoutlines it is a blockchain built for the next generation of apps, games, and the digital assets that power them.
On July 8, FLOW was the 89

leading cryptocurrency. At $15.209 per token, FLOWs market cap is currently at the $674.99 million level.
FLOW/USD Chart
CoinMarketCap
The chart illustrates that FLOW began trading in late January 2021 and traded in a range from around $6.40 to $38.59 per token. The price trended lower since early April, reached a low of $6.67 on June 22, and has been rebounding over the past weeks.
BCD and FLOW are mid-cap cryptocurrencies. When considering adding any cryptos to your portfolio, only invest capital that you can afford to lose as volatility is likely to continue.
Moreover, with over 10,770 cryptos floating around in cyberspace on July 6, many will wind up as dust collectors in computer wallets. Some tokens could deliver incredible rewards, but they will be the exception rather than the norm.

"Crypto Price Prediction: Billionaire CEO Reveals Surprise Link Between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Facebook And Tesla
Ethereum's ether token ""currently looks like the cryptocurrency with the highest real use potential as ethereum, the platform on which it is the native digital currency, is the most popular development platform for smart contract applications,"" Goldman Sachs researchers wrote in a note to clients this week, first reported by
Business Insider
Ethereum has seen a flurry of activity on its network over the last 12 months due to the soaring popularity of so-called decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)both overwhelmingly built on ethereum's blockchain.
This year, DeFi, the idea that traditional financial products can be recreated using crypto technology in place of the bank, has grown to a multi-billion dollar market while NFTs, tokenizing all manner of digital assets and media on the blockchain, have captured the attention of artists, creators and sports stars.
Goldman Sachs is the latest in a string of investors to name etheruem as a better bet than bitcoin. Last month, the chief investment officer at $100 million digital asset investment manage Two Prime predicted ethereum will eventually ""flip"" bitcoin to become the largest cryptocurrency by value

Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, believes the price of Bitcoin could shoot past the price of an ounce of gold  by around 100 times.
In the July 2021 edition of the monthly cryptocurrency newsletter Bloomberg Crypto Outlook, McGlone says that based on technical analysis, the flagship crypto asset could keep appreciating relative to the coveted metal.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bitcoin may be more than a digital version of gold. A potential path for the Bitcoin price is to stabilize around 100x an ounce of gold and for volatility to resume its downward trajectory, if past patterns repeat.
Our graphic depicts a good reason the crypto price could keep advancing relative to the metal, as 260-day Bitcoin volatility appears in early recovery from reaching the lowest ever vs. gold in December.
At the end of 2016, this relative risk measure formed a similar bottom, as the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio breached 1x resistance on the way to 10x in 2017.
One ounce of gold is currently trading at slightly over $1,800.
Bloomberg Crypto Outlook further statesthat the second half of 2021 will be different for the cryptocurrency market compared to the first half.
The crypto market is likely entering a more adult stage in 2H, and we see Bitcoin regaining luster.
Excesses of 1H, as exemplified by Dogecoin, have been alleviated, and the mainstream migration trend appears quite strong, especially if exchange-traded funds in Canada and the elongated waiting list in the U.S. are a guide.
The monthly newsletter adds that the growing adoption of Ethereum is a bullish sign that the second-largest crypto asset by market cap could follow Bitcoins 2017 trajectory going forward.
The go-to platform for cryptos and decentralized finance  Ethereum  appears at a discount within a bull market and could consolidate for a while at $2,000-$4,000. Looking like Bitcoin in 2017, Ethereum has flushed out excessive speculation, while increases in addresses used reflect the accelerating digitalization of money
Akin to Ethereum at the start of this year, the [sic] Bitcoin began 2017 around $1,000 and peaked just below $20,000. Ethereum could stay within the $2,000- $4,000 range since May roughly until October and maintain a 2017 Bitcoin-like flight plan.

Ethereum: Potential Set Up for the Run to $9000 in Place
Two weeks ago, I was looking for Ethereum (ETH) to ideally make a lower low, and then a new attempt at the per Elliott Wave Principle (EWP) anticipated rally to around $9000.
5 minutes ago (Jul 08, 2021 12:51 AM GMT)
Add to Bookmarks
The ideal downside target zone was $1349-1503. ETH bottomed on June 26 at $1717 and has since staged an over 35% rally. Because the ideal downside target was not reached, the question is, is the low in?. In one of my recent daily Crypto Trading Webcasts I suggested my Premium Memberscould initiate long positions on a close back above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Stops could be placed on a daily close below it or at the June 26 low, for example. Straightforward, effective, and already highly profitable trading strategies.

Short-term rallies look impulsive
Since the early June (black) major b-wave high there are five red (intermediate) waves down. Intermediate wave-v should ideally have bottomed around $1349-1503, but all we got was $1717. Thus wave-v could have been a failed 5
th
wave. Since ETH should still be in a robust long-term bull market, a failed fifth wave of a corrective C-wave down is not unexpected: buyers stepped in earlier. ETH then staged a five-day rally, which is a first since the early May all-time high, and it propelled itself back above the 10d, 20d SMA 200-d. Also, this is an encouraging sign because the last time we had such a setup at that aforementioned b-wave high. Moreover, the daily RSI5, MACD, and Money Flow Indicator (MFI) are making new highs since the >60% correction started. The only negative thus far for ETH is that it is still below its Ichimoku Cloud and 50d SMA.
However, the weight of the evidence is shifting in favor of the Bulls. Assuming the June 26 low was (blue) primary wave-IV (can also be labeled as major-4, depending on if one marks the 2017 peak as a Cycle wave or a Primary wave; respectively), ETH has an i, ii, 1, 2 EWP-setup in place. In layman terms, it is making higher highs and higher lows. That is Bullish. Assuming this EWP count is correct, then the internals of red wave-iii coincide well with the ideal green wave-3, 4, 5 framework. Assuming this ideal frameworkalso applies to the internals of (black) major wave-1, we should expect it to top out around $3170-3030. This high is then only the 1
st
wave of the large Primary-V to ideally around $9000, and we know an impulse has five waves; we can expect a (black) major wave-2, 3, 4, and 5. The former two are shown, with the ideal wave-2 target zone shown as well. Wave-3 should then catapult to at least $4500 but will most likely extend to around $5900 instead.
Bottom line: ETH now has enough waves to the downside in place to consider the correction complete, and the postponed run to $9000+ could now be underway. The daily chart is improving from a technical analyses perspective, and as long as the Bulls can hold ETHs price above the June 26 low of $1717, then theres a Bullish EWP setup to propel ETH to initially the low $3000s. Warning signs of this setup not working are at first a move below this Mondays low ($2160) followed by a move below the July 2

Ecosystem participants and builders also agree that in the early stage of the network, speed of iteration is more important than accelerating further decentralization too quickly just for the sake of it, Rogers said in an email. We are fully committed to further decentralize every layer of the Flow ecosystem and are working toward the milestone when anyone around the globe can run a node freely [and] permissionlessly.
Existential questions about ownership, trust and decentralization matter to some users more than others, but Flow has one very concrete advantage over Ethereum: its cheaper. Transaction fees on Ethereum are notoriously expensiveand can run in the hundreds of dollars.
Erick, who built the NFT art platform Art Blocks on Ethereum and who is an investor in Flow (like many in the crypto world, for security reasons he prefers not to disclose his last name, but goes by the handle Snowfro) plans to move some of his lower-cost art to Flow for this reason, with Rariblealso recently announcing it will offer a parallel marketplace on Flow. He thinks the blockchain is taking the right approach.

The cryptocurrency market is effectively treading water over the last couple of weeks, setting up a box range in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
A lack of any noticeable drivers leaves any small rise or fall vulnerable to a pullback, sending volatility lower, and these current ranges may hold over the coming weeks. The market as a whole needs some new motivation, be it positive or negative, to help break these ranges and set up a new trend. Bitcoin is currently capped around $37k and the current spot price remains below all three moving averages, suggesting ongoing bearish sentiment. Ethereum on the other hand is currently being supported by the 200-day sma and shows range resistance of around $2,460.

"So, Is Klaytn a Good Investment?
What is Klaytn?
Klaytn operates on its own blockchain, and instead of using proof of work or proof of stake consensus, it uses a process called Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (
PBFT
). This system allows nodes to share information with each other to process transactions in a matter of seconds.
While this technology may seem superior to the more costly, slower transactions on Ethereum Klaytn sacrifices a level of decentralization. Decentralization is arguably the most critical factor in determining a blockchains security, so some investors may be deterred from Klaytn.
While Klaytn has around 50 validator nodes, Ethereum has over 10,000 independent nodes securing its blockchain. To make Klaytn more decentralized, the protocol hosts different types of nodes (public and private) that verify transactions together.
Klaytn uses the Ethereum token standard on its blockchain. This means that the same types of fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC721) on Ethereum are on Klaytns network. Since Klaytn supports smart contracts, the platform has decentralized exchanges (
) and other programs built on its blockchain.
Brief History of Klaytn
Ground X is the company behind Klaytns blockchain. Jaesun Han is the CEO of GroundX, and he has a long history in distributed computing technology. The platform has several partnerships with established companies that run validator nodes, which helps the trustworthiness of the mere 50 validators on its blockchain.
Klaytn began trading in early 2020 for around 10 cents per token. The cryptocurrency had its 1st significant price increase in August 2020 during the emergence of DeFiprograms.
In March 2020, Klaytn reached its peak alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency market. The token traded for over $4 per token, reaching a market capitalization of about $5 billion. Klaytn has been hit hard in the recent crypto correction, dropping to less than $1 per token  a 75% decrease from its all-time highs.
How To Buy Klaytn
Open an online account.
In order to buy Klaytn, youll need to make an account with a cryptocurrency exchange that supports the token. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, supports Klaytn, and its the best place to buy the token.
To make a Binance account you submit customary know-your-consumer (KYC) information for tax purposes; your information will be held safe through Binance. If youre located in the U.S., it may take a few days for you to be approved for trading.
Buy a wallet (optional).
No matter which cryptocurrency you invest in, its a good idea to store your assets in a dedicated cryptocurrency wallet. Exchanges are large targets for hackers, as these platforms hold custody of all investors funds. The 2 main types of crypto wallets are software and hardware wallets, both of which are more secure than storing crypto on an exchange.
Make your purchase.
Once approved for trading on Binance, youll be ready to make your purchase. Binance lets you purchase Klaytn as a market or limit buy order. Market orders will purchase Klaytn at its market price, usually instantly. Limit orders only execute if Klaytn drops to the price which you specify. If the price of Klaytn doesnt drop to the price you set, then your order will not be executed.
Benzingas Crypto Wallet Picks for Klaytn
Best Hardware Wallet: DCENT
Since Klaytn uses its own proprietary blockchain, you cant store your Klaytn tokens on most hardware wallets. The company actually makes its own hardware wallet, which you can buy on Amazon Compared to other hardware wallets, its inexpensive at just $15. However, youll only be able to store Klaytn and Klaytn-based tokens on the wallet.
Hardware wallets are the most secure way to store crypto. Since hardware wallets are physical devices that store your funds offline, its impossible for online hackers to access your crypto.
Best Software Wallet: TokenPocket
TokenPocket is a software wallet, meaning your crypto will be stored on a computer program with TokenPocket. The crypto wallet supports multiple cryptos, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, Klaytn and Binance Coin (BNB).
Plus, the wallet can connect to DeFi programs, giving you the ability to transfer tokens, earn interest and even provide liquidity to DEXs from your TokenPocket wallet. The wallet is free to use, and its a great alternative to using a hardware wallet.
Klaytn's Competition:
Klaytns largest competitor is Ethereum, but some others are Binance Smart Chain and Solana. If you believe that users will be incentivized to use Klaytn over Ethereum in the future, then the token may be a great addition to your portfolio.
Trade, Sell or Convert your KLAY
When you want to sell or convert your KLAY, simply send your tokens back to Binance. Since Binance offers multiple trading pairs for Klaytn, you can sell your tokens for BTC, BNB or fiat-pegged stablecoins.

Decentralization is 1 of cryptocurrencys greatest advantages, but the majority of traders still use centralized exchanges. This is mostly due to the simple usability of these platforms, making it easy and reliable for anyone with a phone or computer to enter into the crypto market. 0x takes this philosophy of easy access to the crypto market but hosts trading as a decentralized exchange (Dex).
Decentralized exchanges arent new, and 0x isnt even close to being the biggest Ethereum decentralized exchange. However, its strong development team has built it to provide usability in areas other decentralized exchanges arent. The 0x exchange is an application-agnostic exchange making it able to receive and process data from different sources. This protocol allows other platforms to facilitate cryptocurrency trading run by the 0x exchange.
What is 0x?
0x
is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network thats built with optimized order routing to provide a reliable trading protocol that developers can easily implement into their products. The problem with centralized exchanges is that the crypto you are buying is not actually your crypto; its the exchanges crypto they hold on your behalf. The involvement needed by a centralized company is subject to a lot of regulations and relies on trust that the company wont change its rules.
Rule changes by centralized exchanges make incorporating that exchange into other projects unreliable. For instance, if a trading platform used a centralized exchange that ran into a problem where they had to freeze trading, the platform could face repercussions. 0x offers a trustless system to host trading so developers and users can reliably connect to the market.
0x has a governance protocol that allows for improvements to be made on its network through a system of voting. Stakeholders of the 0xs token (ZRX) can vote on proposals that can be implemented into its blockchain so the project will adapt and stay competitive with the rest of its competitors.
0x (ZRX) is Up 21% in 24 Hours
Throughout 0xs history, it has always relatively followed the trend of the crypto market. Shortly after being released in 2017, it reached its all-time high of $2.30 in January of 2018. This price jump is right around when bitcoin reached its early high of $19,000. However, unlike bitcoin, 0x hasnt seen any consistent growth from this point and struggles to break its prior all-time high. The price has followed the recent bull market and reached back up to its high of $2.30, but this spike in price was short-lived as it fell back down to where it is currently at around $0.85. The coins current price range seems to be in a channel of between $0.60 and $1.20 which is a wide margin, but hasnt seen the long term price growth of many other cryptocurrencies.
Why is ZRX Moving?
The crypto protocol Polygon announced on June 10th it has put $7 million into the 0x community to grow its Defi market. On June 10th, however, the 0x price continued to fall despite this significant contribution to its $700 million market cap. The actual effect of this funding wont be seen for a while, and the price will most likely continue with the larger market trend. However, it is a good sign that the 0x protocol is making connections with other platforms and could potentially be used as the Defi backbone for a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.
Where to Buy ZRX
ZRX is a very accessible coin on many of the most popular centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. You can also buy ZRX on their own exchange called Matcha which they link to on the 0x website. This exchange uses all of the other decentralized exchanges to find you the best prices with no commissions.

"What Investors Need to Know About Circle&#8217;s Listing
The Bitcoin blockchain is designed to express a belief in scarcity premised on a right libertarian commodity theoryof money. Bitcoin is a theory of societypredicated on the collapse of the fiat monetary system. The project is sustained by the discourse around bitcoins as a scarce digital gold, digital metallism.In particular, scarcity is built into difficult-to-change code,
Ethereum
Bitcoins political philosophy is well known, but we rarely ask what political philosophy animates Ethereum.
The Ethereum blockchain is often conceptualized as a shared world computer. This computer is agnostic about what happens on it. Ethereum says we are just the infrastructure and how you organize yourselves is up to you. In the
white paper,
Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian computer programmer who co-founded Ethereum, suggests some applications, but those are just suggestions. But to be the neutral infrastructure is deeply political because it expands Ethereum from an economics experiment, like Bitcoin, into an experiment in public goods provisioning.
Story continues
Ethereum is not in the business of confronting the state
Related:
Money Reimagined: Inflation Is Here? Always Has Been
The closest Ethereum came to formalizing a political philosophy was its flirtation with Eric Posner and Glen Weyls radical marketsor radical liberalism. Radical liberalism shares with Ethereum a desire to reimagine the inherited political economy  corrupted democratic institutions, neoliberalism  by creating alternative market arrangements.
Buterin and Weyl co-wrote an academic paperon one such reimagining: quadratic voting for the provisioning of public goods. That found its way into Ethereum with Gitcoins quadratic funding mechanism, where smaller voters are matched by a large pool to ensure the spread of infrastructural funding is varied and reflective of the entire community.
Providing and maintaining infrastructure is central to the Ethereum mind-set, to the Ethereum cryptoculture.
Mutualist Minarchism
Author and philosopher Craig Warmke argues Bitcoin is a case of hyperauthorship.The Bitcoin community collectively tracks the narrative of the movement of bitcoins.
Ethereum is a case of hypergovernance. The Ethereum community collectively creates the infrastructural conditions for new forms of governance. These new forms are alternatives to the inherited ones and implicitly propose to replace them. These surrogates will provide functions previously provided by corrupted democratic states and neoliberalism, but in more decentralized ways.
Ethereum is minarchist. Minarchism is a libertarian position advocating a
night-watchman state.
Associated primarily with philosopher Robert Nozick, minarchism advocates an almost completely anarchist position where all government functions are eliminated except those related to security (police, army, justice).
In Nozicks hands, the night-watchman state is a right libertarian concept, but in Ethereums it morphs into a left libertarian one. The community mutually provides and maintains a shared public good, the Ethereum world computer, but after that its hands-off, i.e. libertarianism.
Ethereum is not in the business of confronting the state, but I do believe it proposes a version of latent minarchism where it provides better infrastructure than the state can. These services would slowly replace their centralized analogues in the traditional world. They cover the broad areas of community well: organizational (decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs), financial (decentralized finance, or DeFi), cultural (non-fungible tokens/social tokens). Minimal mutual governance.
Hash, Bash, Cash
What unites cryptocultures in achieving their various aims is a hash, bash, cash model of decentralized organization. Users hash it out by treating the blockchain as a shared locus of cultural truth and ensuring it remains so. Bashing it out refers to the discourse and cultural values expressed socially among the community. Cashing it out refers to the centrality of money in the cryptocultural experience: investing, trading, exiting. All these experiences bind the community as a culture.
We hash, bash, cash for different reasons, and the assumptions found in one cryptoculture do not carry into another. In Ethereums case, the community hashes, bashes and cashes in order to provide and maintain a shared world computer, a public goods infrastructure. Thats the mutualism. This infrastructure then houses experiments in hypergovernance, thats the minarchism. Ethereums political philosophy is mutualist minarchism.

What Happened: A new report from global cybersecurity firm BrandShield finds that suspicious domain registrations for Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were up 13,331% since August 2020.
This percentage increase is 35 times greater than the number of suspicious domains registered for Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Since last year, suspicious domains registered for Ethereum and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) were up 376% and 324%, respectively.
BrandShields analysis also found that in addition to the explosive growth in fake Dogecoin websites, cybercriminals were also leveraging Tesla Inc's(NASDAQ:
TSLA
) CEO, Elon Musk,name to defraud investors across social platforms.
Why It Matters: As cryptocurrency receives more mainstream coverage, investors of all experience levels are flocking to the alternative capital markets, whether to trade assets for the first time or diversify their investments, said Yoav Keren, co-founder, and CEO of BrandShield.
It shouldnt surprise anyone that cybercriminals are following the money and targeting retail investors with both increasing frequency and sophistication through a wide array of fraud schemes.
Even cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc (CRYPTO: BTC) and Binance became a popular target for cybercriminals.
Coinbase saw a 1728% increase in fake websites, while Binance saw a 616% increase over the same period.

"the framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchains
. The MATIC token is there for governance, staking and gas fees (transaction fees).
Ethereums fundamental problem is its lack of scalability. The greater the number of Ethereum transactions, the greater the congestion. The time it takes to validate each transaction has been rising.
By contrast, Polygon has a way of getting around the scalability problem. It builds snapshots of various chains and uses them in the blockchain network.
This is important because decentralized apps (Dapps) are increasingly popular. They depend on the speed of transactions getting processed, especially in the Defi arena (decentralized finance).
, interest earned and financial rewards and prizes. These types of apps are very popular now in the blockchain world. Polygon can help make their transactions go through without the typical problems that Ethereum can present.
What to Do With MATIC Crypto Now
Polygon is known as a Layer 2 solution to Ethereums problems. As a result of its ability to lower transaction fees and increase processing times of transactions, Ethereum transaction fees have also fallen. According to Coindesk, they have fallen to the level they were at during December 2020 This also means it is at six-month lows.
This proves that Polygon and the MATIC network have real value, especially for the many Defi apps in existence. In the end, that is what will help push up the price of the MATIC token.
As a result, Defi apps are bypassing Ethereum and going straight to Polygon to use as their platform. For example, a new Defi app called Cream Finance was recently launched on the MATIC network according to Decrypt.co. Cream Finance wanted to use the Polygon blockchain because it would lead to faster transaction speeds.
For example, even if MATIC can rise to half of its former height, it would mean reaching a price of $1.7925. That represents a potential gain of over 58.5% from its present price. I suspect that is likely to happen over the next year, especially if Ethereum also rebounds. This is what I expect to happen as well.

After heavy stress and intense movement, rest is always needed. The cryptocurrency market is no exception. After the triumphant breakthrough of the blue trend line by sellers and the USD 175 test, market participants calmed down and met in a local consolidation battle. The last 4-hour candles have record low volumes. Ethereum buyers are eager to break through and fix at least above the price mark of USD 190.
At the moment, a triangle has been formed in which the price can be traded today and tomorrow. Buyers are now showing the ability to keep the price and not let the sellers down. In such a way, they create false breakdowns on increased volumes. It is perfectly visible on the hourly timeframe:
This fact indicates that sellers in this section of the chart do not have enough strength to continue the fall. However, do they have the strength to keep the upper line of the triangle? It would be enough to take Ethereum buyers through long consolidation and continue their plan.
Therefore, after the current sellers attack, it must be clear whether the fall will continue from the current price range, or buyers will be able to correct the price higher, starting at USD 197-200.
So far, buyers are not very upset with the breakthrough of the global trend line. And they are not trying to close their positions:
It means that buyers panic may start later and this will result in a sharp price fall in the short term.
Sellers are trying to exit from a consolidation of their marginal positions upwards, in which they have been since April 2019:
According to the wave analysis, after the test of the first critical point, which we mentioned in the previous analysis the expected rebound is now happening and buyers have reached their first target:
On the chart, we have pointed out three targets where the correction may end. In any case, we think that this is just the beginning of the fall. Probably, Ethereum buyers will have to survive the price lowering to USD 155 and USD 135 in the end. Although, buyers can still enjoy their local initiative. Lets see if buyers can fix over USD 190 by Monday and test USD 197-200. Have a good weekend and see you in the next ETH analysis!

ETH price started a fresh decrease after it failed to climb above the $202 resistance against the US Dollar.
The price is down more than 8% from the high and it is now trading well below $190.
There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could correct higher, but upsides are likely to remain capped near the $190 resistance.
Ethereum price is trading in a bearish zone below $190 versus the US Dollar, and bitcoin declined 8% ETH might correct a few points, but the bulls could struggle to gain traction.
Ethereum Price Analysis
After a strong rejection near the $200 and $202 resistance levels, ETH price declined heavily against the US Dollar. There were also bearish moves in bitcoin and ripplebelow $10,000 and $0.2800 respectively. It opened the doors for more losses and ETH declined below the key $190 support level. Moreover, there was a break below the $188 level plus a close below the 100 hourly simple moving average.
Ethereum price tested the $180 support level and recently corrected higher. There was a break above the $185 level plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $203 high to $180 swing low. However, the upward move was capped by the $190 resistance. Moreover, the price failed to test the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $203 high to $180 swing low.
There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair is now trading well below the $190 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA. On the downside, an immediate support is near the $180 level. If there is a bearish break below $180, Ethereum price is likely to accelerate its decline towards $175 and $172.
On the upside, the bulls are facing a strong resistance near the $190 zone. Therefore, a successful close above the $190 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA is needed for a fresh increase. The next immediate resistance is near the $195 level, followed by the main $202 resistance.
Looking at the chart Ethereum price is clearly facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the $190 and $192 levels. Therefore, there is a risk of more downsides below the $180 support level. Besides, if bitcoin slides further below $9,500, it could drag the crypto market lower.
ETH Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD  The MACD for ETH/USD is about to move back into the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI  The RSI for ETH/USD is currently near the 50 level.

"When is someone going to tell
bitcoin
to slow down? Why, when it drops, does it have to do so in such grandiose fashion?
Bitcoin You Have to Calm Yourself!
The granddaddy of cryptocurrency fell by more than $600 in less than 30 minutes yesterday, dropping from about $10,200 to about $9,600. Unfortunately, things havent quite stopped there. Today, the currency is down by another $200, having fallen into the high $9,400s.
The bad news is that bitcoins behavior seems to be rubbing off on all its altcoin cousins. At press time, many competitors to bitcoin  including Ethereum, Litecoin, bitcoin cash, EOS and Ripples XRP  are down for the count as well, with Ethereum trading in the low $170 range. Many of these coins have lost anywhere between five and 11 percent within the last 24 hours.
The news has got many analysts in a twist, wondering what the heck could have happened and what might have prompted bitcoin to fall so quickly from grace. Several industry experts agree that it was
some sort of mass cash out
, with hodlers selling some of their stashes off to purchase new bitcoin futures set to emerge this coming Friday.
Dave Balter, chief executive of Flipside Crypto Inc. in Boston, comments:
From our end, it looks like it was a sell-off to cash settle futures that are coming due on Friday for BTC.
Jeff Dorman, chief executive at Arca, explains that a lot of cryptocurrency is just sitting there in peoples accounts doing nothing, which means that even the slightest above normal transaction is likely to push crypto over the edge. He states:
Its the week before Labor Day. Half of crypto is at Burning Man and the other half is sitting on their hands doing nothing. Volumes are low, and it takes very little to move markets right now, and you have big futures/ options expirations coming up at the end of the week. The only definitive thing I can point to is that the move was led by declines in EOS, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC and other large-cap tokens that have been out of favor for months. I just dont think there are a lot of investors willing to defend price right now.
Measuring Crypto When It Moves Is Best
This is interesting in the sense that Dorman believes bitcoin is dropping because altcoins are dropping, not the other way around.
According to one source
, market cap isnt a solid factor to determine the overall health of coin. One could purchase an asset when its trading at $100, but then do nothing with it as it jumps beyond the $1,000 mark. Realized capitalization, it suggests, is a far more accurate measure of determining how stable a coin is given that the asset is measured when its moved around.

"ETH-USD
) led the cryptocurrency charge as the asset class emerged over the past few years.
After all of the headlines theyve grabbed, investors understand them much more now than before. Moving forward they will face much more scrutiny and prices wont be as volatile.
Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum are going to fade away, but they have cooled. Theyre basically the old guard and Dogecoin is part of that as well.
Bitcoin and Ethereum paved the way for Dogecoin to take off, and take off it did. But unlike them, Dogecoin lacks utility. Their places are safe, but Dogecoins place is far from it.
Risk Without Utility
In my mind Dogecoin simply remains a risky method by which to make quick trading gains.
It wont be anything until developers figure out how to derive some real world utility from it.
Recently there have been headlines regarding potential use cases that can be built around with Dogecoin. A few weeks ago I wrote about DogeLabs which is a company garnering attention because it may build use cases around DOGE.
You can read my thoughts here but to summarize, the proposed projects were simply loose ideas without much substance.
Throw around Vitalik Buterins name and the idea of a bridge between ETH and DOGE and sure, interest will spike. But crypto investors are getting wiser and hopium becomes less potent the more times you smoke it.
Again, this all points to the bigger idea that DOGE is slowing.
If I can provide any advice here regarding Dogecoin it would be to simply summarize what Ive said above.
It remains useful as a high-risk trading method that can and does provide quick returns. But it is part of an old guard in my opinion and there are lots of newer names with more appeal right now.
Of course the most important thing moving forward is that DOGE has little chance of moving forward until its developers make it useful and give it real world utility.

A few days have passed calmly since our past Ethereum analysis. As we can see on the daily timeframe, the price started to slow down, volumes are falling and all this is happening near the lower trend line of the black wedge. Starting from 17 July, each subsequent local minimum becomes less dangerous and sharp. The situation looks like a gradual decline in the falling trend.
However, we think that without a price range test of USD 155-160, a strong trend of buyers movement will not begin. The fact is that, practically the whole fall period, starting from 10 July, is on small volumes. Since 6 August, volumes have fallen completely. We believe that the USD 155-160 price range should be of interest to active buyers who can wipe out the melancholy fall, get out of the black wedge, and start a new wave of growth. Although, are there such buyers in this price range? A little patience, and we will find out.
At the 4-hour timeframe, we see a price stop at USD 168 and several breakdowns which occurred on small volumes:
If these false breakdowns were on increased volumes, the chances of a price rebound to USD 185 would be greater. And so this phenomenon can be interpreted differently. Ethereum buyers banally do not have the power to keep the price with the help of limit orders. That is, we do not see the big buyers who are ready to keep the price. Everything happens, thanks to small buyers.
Also after false breakdowns, often starts a counter-attack that we do not notice in our situation. Nevertheless, in consolidation, it is important not to guess the side but to support the stronger one. So a little patience and well see if a rebound to USD 185 is possible or sellers will break the black wedge down.
With regard to marginal positions, buyers behave as restrained as possible, without showing their mood and leaving the index of marginal positions in consolidation:
Sellers are trying to increase their positions yesterday and today are in a better mood unlike Bitcoin sellers:
According to wave analysis, we have two scenarios which talk about the continuation of the fall, but with different targets:
The first scenario is the continuation of the movement in the black triangle with a final target of USD 155 (50% Fibonacci level). In this case, we should expect another USD 185 test and then the last wave of fall.
The second scenario, with a target of USD 135, will work if Ethereum sellers break the black trendline of the wedge during the current attack. In this case, the logical end of the wave (Y) will be at the 61.8%level of Fibonacci.
Meet you on Monday and summarize for the month!

FTC extends probe of Amazon, MGM deal - source
Amazon.com's deal to buy movie studio MGM for $8.5 billion is headed for an extended probe by the Federal Trade Commission, after a source familiar with the matter said on Friday the agency had issued a second request in its review of the merger.  Amazon said in May that it would buy the U.S. movie studio, home to the James Bond franchise, which would give it a huge library of films and TV shows to compete with streaming rivals like Netflix and Disney+.  In June, Amazon asked that FTC Chair Lina Khan be recused on antitrust matters related to the online retail giant because of research that she had done and her previous advocacy.

""[Bitcoin and ethereum] are pursuing a multilayer transaction system, but base layer transaction rate is slow and transaction cost is high,"" Musk added.
It's hoped that bitcoin, via its payments-focused lightning network and a recent upgrade called taproot will be able to resolve some of its scaling issues, while etheruem, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is in the midst of a long-awaited upgrade that's not expected to be completed for years.
Musk was replying to a tweetby Wallace that claimed ""the dogecoin update is coming soon,"" and that it ""will position doge perfectly to become one of the most used currencies in the world.""
In May, Musk proposed a dogecoin upgradethat he claimed is ""needed [for dogecoin] to become the currency of Earth"" and beat bitcoin ""hands down.""
The dogecoin price has surged this year, initially riding January's meme stock wave but subsequently developing a haphazard community somewhat led by Musk who envision it eventually competing with the likes of bitcoin and ethereum.
Musk, whose irreverent attitude to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on Twitter has alienated much of the bitcoin community, has previously said all of his dogecoin related comments shouldn't be taken seriously but has since ramped up his support of itissuing calls for developer support and promising to put a ""literal dogecoin on the literal moon"" via his rocket company SpaceX.

Mark Cuban likes Bitcoin, but not as a currency
When it launched in 2009, Bitcoin was lauded as the world's first digital currency. Built with blockchain technology, the idea was to enable payments without a middleman such as a bank.
But Cuban, who said about 60% of his crypto is in Bitcoin, 30% in Ethereum, and 10% in other coins, disagrees.
Speaking on The Delphi Podcast, Cuban explained that when it comes to Bitcoin being a digital currency, ""It's not going to work."" In his mind, ""It's too hard. It's too slow. There's a limit on the transactions."" He believes Ethereum the second-biggest crypto, is as close as we have to a true digital currency.
Instead, Cuban argues that Bitcoin is digital gold and considers it a store of value, not a currency.

It's a safe bet -- something you can buy today and be confident won't lose value by the time you want to sell it.
The fact that Cuban sees Bitcoin as a store of value may surprise you, especially if you've been hearing about how risky the digital currency is. But volatility aside, Cuban sees the potential of Bitcoin to be as good as -- if not better than -- gold.
He goes on to say, ""The whole time, I said there was a store of value where if you could get people to believe it was a better alternative to gold, then -- because of algorithmic scarcity -- the price would go up.""
What's algorithmic scarcity?
Like gold, Bitcoin has a limited supply.
Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be produced -- it's baked into its algorithms. Unlike, say, U.S. dollars, nobody can suddenly decide to print more. Not only that, but there will be a constant and predictable supply of Bitcoin until the last one is mined in 2040.
Cuban points out that unlike Bitcoin, you can print more money. Companies can produce more shares. But you know exactly how many Bitcoins will ever exist. That scarcity is one thing it has in common with gold. It's also durable, portable, and divisible -- all qualities that make for a good store of value.
On the other side, there are people who say that Bitcoin doesn't have
any
inherent value and that this is a bubble that will burst. But the same could be said for U.S. dollars -- no currency has value unless we believe it does. When we accept the dollar as a form of payment, we give it its value.

But the biggest objection to seeing Bitcoin as akin to gold is its volatility. If you'd bought Bitcoinat its first peak in 2017 and watched the price fall soon after, you probably wouldn't think it was as safe as gold. But if you had held on to it, your Bitcoin would be worth a lot more today
Will Bitcoin's value stabilize?
Whether or not Cuban is right remains to be seen. For now, there's a slight difference between Bitcoin being a good investment and it being a good store of value. You can buy a volatile investment, confident that even if the price drops dramatically, it will rise again. The Ascent's parent company, The Motley Fool, owns Bitcoin because it sees the currency as a good long-term investment.
Many believe that the volatility will stabilize. Assuming it does, it's easy to see why Mark Cuban would compare Bitcoin to gold. Not only do they share many of the same characteristics, but Bitcoin is easier to transport.

Polkadot helps blockchains work together, solving a problem called ""interoperability.""
We've talked a lot about Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), but they're not the only programmable blockchain technologyon the market. A programmable blockchain is a place where developers can build decentralized applications (Dapps) and other cryptocurrencies
Ethereum
was the first, and various others followed in its wake. However, Ethereum is not perfect. Until it completes its upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 it will continue to be relatively slow and unsustainable. Plus, it doesn't play well with other blockchains, a problem people refer to as ""interoperability.""
That's where Polkadot comes in.

Polkadot basics
Polkadot solves the interoperability problem by helping cryptocurrencies talk to one another.
Think of it like computer operating systems: You can't always transfer things easily from a Mac to a PC or a Samsung phone to an Apple phone. In the same way, you might want something that was built on the Ethereum network to interact with the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.
Whether it's transferring assets from one platform to another or creating programs that interact with programs on other networks, Polkadot is like a translator that helps them all speak the same language.
What it does:
Polkadot helps different blockchain networks work with each other.
Token:
DOT
Founders and management team:
Robert Habermeier, Dr. Gavin Wood, and Peter Czaban. All three have good crypto credentials and Dr. Wood was one of Ethereum's co-founders.
Date launched:
The company's ICO took place in 2017 and it launched DOT in 2020.
Market cap:
$19 billion (CoinMarketCap, June 2021).
Availability:
Most major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges
Should you buy it
Like all cryptocurrencies, Polkadot is a highly volatile investment, which means you might see high gains, but you could also see big losses. And this is a relatively untested market, so we don't know which coins will still be around in five or 10 years' time. Many cryptocurrencies have already failed, and others are sure to do so.
That said, Polkadot has some solid fundamentals. It has an experienced management team and a wide and dedicated community of developers. Most importantly, its technology could solve a key crypto problem: interoperability.
Here are two other things I like about DOT.
1. Staking
You can stake your DOT to earn interest on it, a bit like dividend-paying stocks. When you stake funds, you commit to leaving them untouched for a set period of time, and your tokens are used to validate the rest of the network. Depending on how long you are willing to tie up your coins, it can pay an average of 10% in interest. The rates change depending on how many coins are being staked.
2. A number of projects are running on its ecosystem
Polkadot has over 250 projects running on its network, according to
Decrypt
. These range from gaming platforms to new cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi)applications. Developers can use something called ""parachains"" to build applications. These connect back to the main blockchain, but reduce congestion on the main network. Polkadot has also attracted a digital asset management company that will fund promising projects on its ecosystem.
Be aware of the risks
We've covered some of the exciting things about Polkadot, but let's finish by touching on some of the specific risks as well.
1. Security
The wallets of Polkadot's founders were hacked twice in its early days. Around 60% of the funds from Polkadot's 2017 ICO were frozen after one of its development teams was attacked. The system flaws were fixed, and the hack was not directly on Polkadot's network. There have been no instances in recent years.
Some analysts have also raised concerns about the way Polkadot uses fishermen -- like bounty hunters -- to secure its network. In theory, the fishermen provide an extra layer of security because they are rewarded if they find compromised blocks in the chain. The concern is that there may not be enough incentive for the fishermen to keep fishing, especially as people are unlikely to misbehave.
2. Competition
The race is on to be
the
main platform for applications, and right now Ethereum is ahead of the pack. As we touched on above, Ethereum has some issues, but if it can move smoothly to Ethereum 2.0, it's likely to keep that top spot for a while.
Cardano
is also an important contender. It has taken longer to develop its blockchain, but if it can achieve its promise, it could be a serious threat to Polkadot. Interoperability will be built into Cardano's network, which might lessen Polkadot's appeal. Other blockchains worth watching are EOS (EOS) and NEO (NEO).
However, it's unlikely that this will be a winner-takes-all scenario -- especially with Polkadot in the mix. In theory, developers will be able to pick and choose the capabilities they like from different platforms and use Polkadot to make them work together.
I'm a fan of several of these programmable blockchains because they have the potential to change so many industries from finance to manufacturing to healthcare. That's why I own a number of them, including Polkadot. It may be too early to know who will win this race, but we can identify the frontrunners.

For more than a century, the stock market has been one of America's top wealth creators. Although there have been short periods of time where other asset classes have outperformed, no investment vehicle has delivered higher average annual returns over the very long run than stocks.
However, the stock market has been knocked off of its perch over the past decade by the insane returns of cryptocurrencies While Bitcoin tends to get all the glory, it's the world's second-largest digital currency by market value, Ethereum
(
CRYPTO:ETH
)
, that's been the markedly better performer of late. Over the trailing year, Ethereum has risen by 1,620%, which is over four times higher than Bitcoin's 384% return.
Image source: Getty Images.
Ethereum has been on fire, but this move isn't sustainable
If you're wondering why Ethereum is outperforming, look no further than decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi is a financially focused blockchainthat utilizes smart contracts-- protocols that help to verify, facilitate, and enforce negotiated contracts -- and eliminates other financial intermediaries that can slow or block payments, such as banks. Ethereum's smart contracts are exceptionally popular, and have become the foundation from which DeFi is being developed.
Ethereum's underlying blockchain has also had plenty of interest from the business community. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which aims to broaden the adoption of Ethereum's smart-contract-driven blockchain technology, has more than 200 members.
Furthermore, Ethereum has seen its average daily transactions steadily rise over the past year.
While this is all seemingly encouraging, it's a massive stretch to suggest Ethereum is worth close to $400 billion. To put this into some perspective, Visa handled nearly 453 million daily transactions in 2018, according to the Nilson Report. Ethereum's blockchain has been handling closer to 1.5 million daily, of late. Yet in spite of this milewide disparity Ethereum's market value trails Visa by only $100 billion.
What's more, blockchain suffers from a Catch-22 Businesses are unwilling to switch away from traditional networks without proof that blockchain-based technology can hold up in the real world. Unfortunately, without big businesses making this shift, there's no concrete data proving that Ethereum's blockchain is the superior answer to existing infrastructure.

Ditch Ethereum for these innovative growth stocks
The fact of the matter is that there are better places to put your money to work right now than Ethereum. If you desire to be on the leading edge of innovation, you certainly don't need the untested crypto space to accomplish it. Instead, consider buying into the following trio of game-changing growth stocks all of which have the potential to make you rich.
Pinterest
I don't have one really good reason to buy a stake in social media platform Pinterest
(
)
-- I have 478 million very good reasons you should consider it.
When the quarter ended in March, Pinterest reported net global monthly active user (MAU) growth of 30% to 478 million. Even though its user growth has been positively impacted by people being stuck in their homes during the pandemic, it's important to note that the company was growing its MAUs by an annual average of 30% in the three years leading up to the pandemic. It really hasn't mattered whether people are stuck at home or living life normally.
Also of note, a majority of the company's new MAUs have originated in international markets (103 million of the 111 million net MAUs gained year over year, through March 2021). Even though average revenue per user (ARPU) is substantially higher in the U.S., Pinterest's skyrocketing user growth outside the countryis what'll allow it to double its overseas ARPU multiple times this decade. In other words, international user growth is precisely why Pinterest should be one of the fastest-growing social media stocks this decade.
Another reason Pinterest is such a no-brainer buyis because its users are willingly providing valuable information about what products, services, and places they like. This makes the platform perfect for targeted advertising and merchants looking to make a sale. Slowly but surely, Pinterest could become a force within e-commerce.

Skillz
Another innovative growth stock with the potential to make investors very rich over the long run is esports and gaming company Skillz
(
)
.
The gaming industry is highly competitive, and there's a good likelihood that new entrants will get squashed by the more established developers. Instead of spending big bucks to develop new games and hope they resonate with gaming community, Skillz chose to develop a platform that allows esports participants and more traditional gamers to compete against each other for cash prizes. Skillz and game developers are then able to keep a percentage of the cash prize.
The beauty of operating a gaming platform is twofold. First, Skillz isn't tethered to specific developers or gaming genres. In effect, the entire gaming universe could be potential players on its platform. And second, Skillz doesn't have to spend a boatload of money developing games. As a result, its gross margin has consistently been a juicy 95% for two years
The NFL can also be a significant catalyst. In February, Skillz and the NFL signed a multiyear agreementthat'll see gaming developers create NFL-themed games for future competitions. Football is the unquestioned most popular sport in the U.S., which should give the company ample momentum once NFL-focused games hit the platform in late 2021 or early 2022.
Wall Street is looking for Skillz to quadruple its sales over the next four years. With 17% of its players being paying customers (that's well above the industry average), this lofty estimate is believable.

Trupanion
A third game-changing growth stock to buy instead of Ethereum is pet-focused health insurance company Trupanion

Americans absolutely love their four-legged family members and are more than willing to spend big bucks to ensure their well-being. According to data from the American Pet Products Association, nearly $110 billion will be spent on pets in the U.S. this year. More importantly, it's been over a quarter of a century since we've witnessed a year-over-year decline in pet expenditures. It may not be the fastest-growing industry, but it's about as steady as they come

Ethereum price is currently consolidating losses against the US Dollar and bitcoin ETH price could either climb above $195 and $200 or it might resume its decline.
Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis
This past week, bitcoinand Ethereum declined heavily below $10,000 and $200 respectively against the US Dollar. The ETH/USD pair even broke the $190 support and settled well below the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, there was a push below the $185 support level and the price traded as low as $174. Recently, it started an upside correction and recovered above the $180 level.
Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $217 high to $174 swing low. However, there are many resistances on the upside near the $192, $195 and $200 levels. Additionally, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $195 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD. The trend line coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $217 high to $174 swing low.
The most important resistance is near the $200 and $202 levels (the previous supports). Therefore, a successful break above the $195 resistance plus a follow through above $200 is needed for a fresh increase. The next key resistance is near the $207 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Besides, the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $217 high to $174 swing low is also near $207.
Conversely, if there is no upside break above $195 or $200, the price could resume its decline. An immediate support is near the $180 level, followed by the $174 swing low. A break below the $174 swing low may perhaps push the price towards $162.
The above chartindicates that Ethereum price is currently consolidating below key resistances such as $192, $195 and $200. To start a strong recovery and upward move, the price must settle above $200 in the coming days.
Technical Indicators

"The ETH sellers remain in control starting out a fresh week.
Ethereum weighs in Elon Musks tweet and Feds concerns on crypto assets.
The no.2 coin at risk of a rising channel breakdown on the 12H chart.
Amid the absence of weekend love, the most widely trading crypto assets are extending last weeks sluggish momentum starting out a fresh week on Sunday.
Elon Musks, Tesla Inc.s founder, warning against Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting that theirtransaction rate was ""slow"" and cost ""high, remains a weight on the no. 2 coin.
Meanwhile, the USFederal Reserve (Fed), for the very first time, flagged digital assets, in its semi-annual
Monetary Policy Report
to Congress released on Friday.
The surge in the prices of a variety of crypto assets also reflects in part increased risk appetite, the report added. This came as Bitcoin priceis up some 250% from a year ago, although it is well down from its April high.
As of writing, ETH/USD is down 1% on the day, trading just shy of $2100. Ethereum is shedding nearly 10% over the past seven days.
ETH/USD: Risks remain skewed to the downside amid rejection above 50-SMA
Ethereums 12-hour chart shows that the price is challenging the rising trendline support at $2091, with a candlestickclosing below that level likely to validate a downside breakout from a three-week-old rising channel formation.
Note that ETH price trades below all the major Simple Moving Averages (SMA) on the given time frame while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) points south below the midline, both of which suggest a likelihood for additional downside.
If the channel breakdown materializes then a drop towards the $2000 psychological level cannot be ruled. A sustained breach of the last could prompt a sharp sell-off towards the $1720-$1730 region, where the June 26 low aligns. 
ETH/USD: 12-hour chart
Alternatively, acceptance above the 50-SMA at $2120 is critical for the ETH bulls to aim for any meaningful recovery towards the mildly bearish 21-SMA at $2194.
Further north, the $2500 psychological barrier could be challenged once again.
All in all, the path of least resistance appears to the downside for Ethereum price

"ZRX
) decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol has been suspended after a vulnerability has been uncovered in its code, the projects team announced in a Medium post publishedon July 13.
Per the announcement, third-party security researcher samczsunwarned the 0x team about the vulnerability in the exchange smart contract and, after evaluating it, the team suspended the exchanges contract and the AssetProxy contracts.
The vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to fill certain orders with invalid signatures. The announcement reassures that one has exploited this vulnerability and no users have lost their funds. The only consequence is apparently a temporary suspension of the service:
Unfortunately, this also means the currently deployed 0x contracts cannot process trades and are unable to be used. A patched version of the Exchange contract  that we are confident fixes this vulnerability  and new AssetProxy contracts are being deployed to the Ethereum mainnet and we expect them to be ready to use later tonight.
Lastly, the team notes that the vulnerability is not contained in its ZRX token contract and that user funds are safe. They thanked the security researchers while inviting other white hat hackers to participate in 0xs bug bounty program:
We also want to extend our sincerest gratitude to samczsun. We continue to offer a generous bug bountyto white hat hackers and community members that identify potential vulnerabilities. 
As Cointelegraph reportedin October last year, ZRX was the first ERC20 token to be listed on the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange.
At the beginning of May, the Tron Foundation discloseda fixed vulnerability that could have crashed its blockchain.

Axie Infinity crypto (AXS) was the talk of the blockchain last week. That shows in the tokens price today. But it could be destined for even greater things.
In the first week of July, AXS soared to an all-time high of $19.60, putting AXS about 486% above its June low.
It was after co-founder Jiho Zirlin claimed on Twitter that his cryptocurrencygenerated more revenue than Metamsk, Pancakeswap, MakerDAO, and Curve combined the week of June 28.
He added that Axie is due for many upgrades over the next year and beyond.
Axie Infinity could be a blockchain gold mine if you know how to use it.
Heres why its not like other cryptos  and the profit opportunity in that.
What Is Axie Infinity Crypto?
Axie Infinity is one of the more unique blockchain ideas youll find out there.
Youve heard of Bitcoin mining. Youve heard of Ethereum staking. Maybe youve even heard of Tezos baking or Chia farming.
Axie is something different entirely. You battle for cryptocurrency. Yes, you compete in an Ethereum blockchain-based video game.
The simulated universe is inspired by Pokemon. Players collect wild creatures called Axies, raise them, house them, and pit them against other Axies with special powers.
Each Axie is a non-fungible token(NFT) that goes for a certain amount of Ethereum. Even before its been fully released to the public, the game has so far generated more than 13,000 ETH in revenue (16 million).
People are, of course, attracted to the prospect of competing for wealth. The play-to-earn model is an enticing in contrast to the typical reward-based crypto earning systems.
But an immersive ecosystem as this could attract a whole new breed of crypto die-hards to this game.
It offers not one but several digital tokens in the game  along with Axies, players can trade love potions to farm them, all selling for ETH. They can be traded on Binance or Uniswap.
As you can see, this world contains almost limitless potential. And if it captures an audience anything like World of Warcraft or Age of Empires, this is something to keep your eye on.
Heres what is so special about the AXS token in particular, though
Whats Happening with Axie Infinity Crypto
In 2021, Axie players were given the ability to earn the Axie Infinity governance token, AXS, which represents ownership of the game itself. Holding the coin gives players voting power to make decisions about Axie Infinity crypto in the future.
We recently saw Small Love Potion (SLP), one of the potions in Axie, more than double as well. It rushed from $0.11 to $0.27 between June 20 and now, a gain of 145%.
This points to increased interest and adoption of Axie Infinity. And because the project is still very much in a basic beta stage, the ecosystem has plenty of opportunity to expand.
Delphi Digital reports that ever since the Ethereum sidechain Ronin was launched exclusively for Axie Infinity, the game has been substantially adopted in the Philippines, Cuba, and Venezuela.
A booming AXS means a booming SLP and vice versa. The fact that this is a game containing multiple tokens gives Axie Infinity an advantage in the crypto world. All it needs to do is develop is brand properly for its target audience and create an endless line of exciting tokens within the game.
More than $25 million AXS exchange hands daily, with more than 50,000 NFTs sold in the Axie Infinity ecosystem.
All that said, here are the Axie Infinity price predictions for you today
Axie Infinity Crypto Price Prediction
As we mentioned above, AXS growth will all depend on how well the game catches on over the months and years. Its tough to know for sure, but theres plenty of opportunity for Axie if developers and governance token holders play their cards right.
For some players, Axie Infinity has become a full-time job. Some Axie characters sell for 30 ETH, and some plots of land in the game can go for 270 ETH.
The ETH price today is $2,034, by the way.
Needless to say, many are optimistic about the AXS price in the future.
Here are the Axie Infinity price predictions for 2021 and beyond.
CoinQuora expects the coin to finally reach $20 this year. Because crypto has been so volatile and responsive to celebrity Twitter comments over the last year, Axie is a major candidate to become a meme at least once more this year. We know that a hopeful outlook from the co-founder helped bring the coin to todays levels, but it could also spike organically on sheer love of the game.
Further down the line, CoinCodex expects AXS to hit $61.87 in 2025. That would be more than double what it is now. It sounds ambitious, but when you think about how fast crypto can move, 200% over five years is modest for what you might expect from a highly adopted crypto. We saw 200% from Bitcoin in 2021 alone.
If Axie Infinity is all its cracked up to be, WalletInvestor offers an exciting $83 price target by 2025. Thats more than 300% growth, which is another ambitious-sounding but highly plausible target if Axie Infinity can polish its product successfully.

"As the worlds largest digital asset manager, Grayscale has announced that its Digital Large Cap Fund has now become a reporting company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund will be joining both Grayscale's Bitcoin and Ethereum trust as reporting products. The trusts shares period lock-up has been reduced from twelve months to six with potential implications on the market.Owned by Coindesks parent company, Digital Currency Group, Greyscale has aimed to revolutionize investing by making a case for digital assets. Since filing SEC Form 10 in October 2020, Greyscale had only been given approval for Bitcoin and Ethereum trust funds. With this update, Greyscale improves the marketability for their Digital Large Cap Fund. The regulatory approval lessens institutional investors' apprehension that investing may pose legal risks.Digital large cap fund reduces lock-up periodGrayscale filed to make the Large Cap Fund an SEC-reporting company back in May. The Large Cap Fund is composed of: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chainlink (LINK), and Cardano (ADA). Now being an SEC-reporting company, this will reduce Grayscales lock-up period in half. Many experts have been speculating about the possible impact and implications this can have on the market.A key affect is that wealthy and institutional investors who buy shares in this fund can liquidate their shares on the retail market in less time than anticipated.Come July 17, roughly 16,000 BTC will unlock from Grayscale's BTC trust. With many other lockup periods ending this month, experts are conflicted as to whether this can place downward pressure on assets price points. Other experts speculate the expiration of the lockup period will not create as much volatility as expected since investors will want to protect themselves from a loss.How being an SEC-reporting company affects Greyscale's future:With this new update and registration, Grayscale is required to file quarterly and annual financial statements, 10-Qs and 10-Ks, as well as Form 8-Ks for significant events. According to Grayscales vice president of legal, Craig Salm, the SEC reporting status provides necessary assurance for conservative investors and firms who were otherwise crypto adverse.Gaining both traction and popularity, the company has found its niche by offering digital asset shares in a trust that holds the coins. This arrangement lets people buy and sell them on the stock market. Given the various Grayscale trusts, institutional and retail investors lean in as it provides the opportunity for them to have crypto exposure in their broader portfolios.Now institutions are buying Grayscale products because they know there will be an ETF, and [the Grayscale shares] are a way to get Bitcoin cheap, says Salm. With a potential ETF looming, investors are rushing in to buy shares in hopes to arbitrage. However, in order for this to occur, the SEC must approve an ETF for either Bitcoin or Ethereum.Currently, several companies including Grayscale have filed for such an approval, but the process has hit a standstill and some say it can drag into next year. While acknowledging this will not occur until 2022, Salm is optimistic that it may come sooner as Grayscale is ready to convert its existing trust shares into ETF shares.While awaiting the SECs greenlight, the decision for the company to obtain reporting status and seek further reporting status places it in a good position for the future crypto ETF era. With tens of billions of digital assets under management, Grayscale continues to innovate traditional investing.",2021-07-12,0.9943,0.129,0.014,0.856

Australia-based blockchain company Power Ledger is migrating to Solana from Ethereum in search of higher speed and scalability. ""The Hash"" hosts discuss Solana as a rising protocol looking to take on Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space. ""Ethereum's very likely to be the winner here,"" host Adam B.

Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Big crypto needs to prove itself as downside risk multiplies
|
7/12/2021 5:25:23 PM GMT
Bitcoin price closed the week down -2.9% but remained well above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA).
Ethereum price closed the week down -7.85% after making a brief rebound high.
XRP price closed the week down -8.62% and below the tactically important $0.650 price level.
Bitcoin price
is now down -4.44% for the month as it clings to the support formalized by the 12-month simple moving average (SMA). Ethereum price is down -7.75% for the month but barely holds the instructive 2020 ascending trend line. Meanwhile, XRP is down -10.24% this month while navigating a range framed by the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the 78.6% Fibonacciretracement level.
Bitcoin price support aligns, but can it hold
Beginning in June, Bitcoin price has been examining the credibility of the support offered by the 12-month SMA currently at $32,135, with success. The 12-month SMA merges with the head-and-shoulders neckline that extends from January 2021 through May 2021, creating formidable support for intra-month weakness.
Solidifying the support around the 12-month SMA is the 50-week SMA at $31,906 as Bitcoin price has not closed below the tactically important moving average on a weekly basis since the corrective process began in April.
However, on July 8, Bitcoin price triggered a rising wedge pattern that had dominated BTC from the June 22 low of $28,800, augmenting the probability that risk is tilted to the downside moving forward.
The measured move of the rising wedge pattern is 27%, projecting an ultimate Bitcoin price low of $25,000 if the breakdown gains momentum. A decline of that magnitude would shutter the enduring BTC bullish forecastand, more importantly, transform the resilient support around $30,000 into an imposing resistance level for any rebound attempts from the measured move target of $25,000.
The Bitcoin price drop to the measured move target would confirm the breakdown from the larger head-and-shoulders pattern, first triggered on June 22, and displace the BTC support invoked by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the 2020-2021 rally at $27,175.
Thus, to avoid the bearish outcome, Bitcoin price needs to hold the 12-month SMA at $32,135, the 50-week SMA at $31,906 and the head-and-shoulders neckline at $30,640 on a weekly closing basis.
BTC/USD weekly chart
For now, until Bitcoin price can log a daily close above the wedges upper trend line and the Anchored VWAP from October 21 at $37,690, it is forecasted that BTC will continue to churn in the range manufactured since the May 19 low.
Here, FXStreet's analysts evaluate where BTC could be heading next as it seems bound for a rebound.
Ethereum price surfing critical support as broad crypto market roils
On July 8, Ethereum price collapsed below the lower trend line of a rising wedge pattern at $2,330, resolving the price structure that directed ETH since the doji candlesticklow on June 22.
Since the breakdown, Ethereum price has surfed along the support granted by the February high at $2,041, and reinforced by the 200-day SMA at $2,030 and the ascending 2020 trend line now at $1,970.
A daily close below $1,970 would instantly tilt the ETH risk further to the downsideand set in motion a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of 2020-2021 advance at $1,730. If Ethereum price perfects a weekly close below $1,717, it would trigger the larger descending triangle pattern (highlighted in blue) and announce the potential for an additional 40% plunge based on the measured move of the descending triangle. More specifically, a 40% decline from the triangle breakout would equate to a price below $1,000.
An Ethereum pricemove of 40% would be challenged by the 12-month SMA at $1,420, the 2018 high at $1,419 and the 50-week SMA at $1,386. In fact, ETH should struggle to extend the sell-off beyond those levels, representing a 34% spike lower from the current price and a 19% decline from $1,717.
ETH/USD weekly chart
A daily close above the 50-day SMA at $2,341 would negate the short-term bearish outlook, but investors should not overlook the descending triangles upper trend line, now at $2,570. Itwill press down on price, limiting upside potential.
Here, FXStreet's analysts evaluate where ETH could be heading next as it seems bound for an upswing.
XRP price widens trading range, but still void of any actionable clues
Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP price triggered a minor rising wedge pattern much sooner, on July 1, before shuffling into a consolidation along the critically important $0.650 price level, which corresponds with the May 23 low. The consolidative process broke on July 8. Ripple now cannot recover $0.65, thereby broadening the trading range, with support currentlyat the 50-week SMA at $0.566 or the 78.6% retracement level at $0.555.
The wedges measured move is around 30%, indicating that XRP price will push through the Fibonacci level and the June low at $0.512 before settling for support at $0.477. To reach the target price, Ripple needs to fall 24% from the current price level.
XRP/USD weekly chart
The best Ripple market operators can hope for at this point is for XRP price to oscillate around $0.650, and only a daily close above $0.770 would disrupt the bearish forecastbeing depicted in the Ripple charts of various timeframes.
In a cryptocurrency market characterized by wavering commitment and intensifying risk to the downside, market speculators should practice patience and let the digital tokens prove themselves before making definitive trading decisions. It is important to remember that investors have nothing to prove to the markets; instead,the markets must constantly prove themselves.
Here, FXStreet's analysts evaluate where Ripplecould be heading next as it seems bound for an upswing.

"Is Near Protocol a Good Investment?
What is Near Protocol?
NEAR is the native token of its blockchain and has multiple uses within the system. NEAR can be staked or delegated with a validator node to help run the networks Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. NEAR can also be used in integration with decentralized apps such as marketplaces where you can buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Like Ethereum, transaction fees on Near are paid with its native cryptocurrency: Ether on Ethereum is to NEAR on Near Protocol.
Near recognizes the largest issue with the DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum  high transaction fees. Although the list of platforms on the network is minuscule compared to its competitors, the technology is impressive and may entice developers and users to switch to Near. It uses the brilliant technology of sharding where the blockchain is split across many validator nodes to spread out the workload, decreasing congestion. High transaction fees have driven many users away from Ethereum to cheaper alternatives like Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BSC has minimal fees, but it sacrifices one of the main tenets of decentralized finance  decentralization.
Near prides itself on its decentralization and transparency with its community. The entire network is open-source, and developers from around the world have contributed to the project. An impressive core team of more than 50 members works for Near and many more are contracted to build out and improve the network. DeFi users shouldnt have to sacrifice decentralization or large sums of crypto (in the form of transaction fees) to use DApps, and Near may be the best solution, at least until Ethereum 2.0 is complete.
Brief History of Near Protocol
Near first started in the summer of 2018 after the 2 founders Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin pivoted from a previous business venture. They were working on a project to automate programming before they realized it wasnt viable with the technology available at the time. They decided to move to the cryptocurrency sphere after trying to automate smart contract generation on Ethereum. Shortly after, Near Protocol was born.
Skidanov and Polosukhin quickly acquired new hires around the world and built what they call the Near Collective. They wanted to make Near a completely open-source platform where anyone could add or suggest changes to the code. The website has a list of Bounties where programmers can apply to build part of the expanding Near ecosystem for rewards.
The NEAR token has experienced a wild ride in price fluctuations this year, at least partially because of its relatively small market capitalization of about $850 million. At the beginning of 2021, it was worth about $1.40 per token and it steadily rose for months until it reached its all-time high of $7.57 in March. It stayed between $4 and $7 until the entire crypto market crashed in May. At the time of writing it is hovering around $2.05 after recovering from a dip to $1.86 on June 26.
How to buy Near Protocol
Looking for an easy guide to buy NEAR tokens? Follow these quick steps to pick some up for yourself today!
Open an online account.
NEAR is available on a few trading platforms including Binance and Crypto.com. However, Binance only supports NEAR on Binance.com, which isnt available to U.S customers. Because of this, Crypto.com will likely be the best place to purchase NEAR for U.S. investors. Crypto.com has a sleek and powerful application on iOS and Android phones.
Before you can purchase NEAR you will need to verify your exchange account. In the U.S. this usually entails providing your address, Social Security number and a picture of your drivers license or passport. If you plan on using your NEAR tokens on DApps on the network, you will need to set up a wallet to store and transfer the tokens.
Buy a wallet (optional).
You could simply leave your NEAR in the exchange you purchased it from, but without a hardware or software wallet, you cant do much with the token beyond price speculation. Moving your tokens to a personal wallet also gives you more control over your tokens. Successful hacks on major exchanges have lost users millions of dollars worth of cryptos over the years. Even though the largest exchanges today like Crypto.com are extremely secure, hardware wallets eliminate the risk of cyberattacks.
Make your purchase.
Now that your account is set up and verified you can fund your account and start trading NEAR. The easiest and fastest method to fund your Crypto.com account with U.S. dollars is through instant ACH deposits. The app guides you through the simple steps to link your bank account to make your deposit. You can also send other supported cryptos to your Crypto.com account and trade them for NEAR. Once your account is funded, just find the trading pair you want with Near such as NEAR/tether (USDT) and make your purchase.
Best Crypto Wallets For NEAR Protocol
Best Hardware Wallet: Ledger
Ledger is a leading hardware wallet brand that boasts thousands of supported cryptocurrencies, including NEAR token. Unfortunately, Ledger doesnt support NEAR out of the box and requires users to install the Near app on their devices first. Ledger has a quick and simple guideon how to download and set it up.
Ledger produces 2 hardware wallet models dubbed the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X. Both devices have the same secure chip that randomly generates and encrypts your wallets private keys, the only access point to your cryptos. The Nano S is the more basic model and is perfect for beginners. The Nano X adds a larger screen and Bluetooth functionality to facilitate on-the-go use.
Best Software Wallet: Near Wallet
Near Protocol is designed for decentralized applications, and a software wallet is often necessary to interact with these types of programs. NEAR isnt supported by most of the major software wallets such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet, but the company has a proprietary wallet to use with its token. Unlike wallets on Ethereum, Near Wallet requires a small amount of NEAR token to open an account. You will need to buy some on an exchange or get a friend to send you the required 0.2 NEAR first. Once your account is set up you can transfer ERC-20 tokens from your Ethereum wallet to your Near Wallet and start using DApps on the exciting new network.
Bonus Section
Adoption is probably the most important factor in the growth of Near Protocol. It is already an efficient smart contract platform with the potential for great DApps, but it may need more users and developers to see greater success.
Trade, Sell or Convert Your NEAR
NEAR is a volatile asset and that wont change any time soon. Smaller volumes of trading can push the price up or down because of its relatively small market capitalization. Also, if the network doesnt attract enough developers and users on major applications, NEARs price may be severely affected in the long term.
For these reasons you need to know how to close your NEAR position. Luckily, Crypto.com and Binance make i",2021-07-12,0.9993,0.13,0.017,0.853

only standing Victorian Queen Anne mansion. It is a national Historic Place designated by federal government, and an official Landmark Building of the city.
NFTs have dominated in the digital art and other digital collectibles over the past year. Based on block-chain technology, NFTs are almost immune to unauthorized copying or changing, making it a powerful vehicle to represent digital proprietary rights. The wave was followed by sports related events like the Super Bowl and Kentucky Derby, along with unique collectibles involving iconic celebrities.
Historical buildings hold unique artistic and collectible value, which can be tokenized into NFTs, making them available and accessible to broader groups of collectors and sponsors. Partnering with
Atlanta
-based Great Estate NFT and
Singapore
-based Bingoo Fintech, UC Asset will transfer certain artistic and proprietary rights derived from historical landmark buildings to its technology partners, who will build those unique proprietary rights into Ethereum-based NFTs and sell them, repaying UC Asset for use of its property rights.
""People have been selling real estate NFTs but as far as we have observed, they are virtual properties built in a virtual block-chain world with no physical existence in the real world; and do not offer buyers access to real properties."" explains
Larry Wu
, founder of UC Asset. ""The NFTs offered by our technology partners will be the first of a kind, which will represent proprietary rights as both a piece of digital artwork and a piece of real estate. We believe this disruptive concept of interweaving the digital and physical world will lead the new trend of NFT creation.""
Wu suggests historical landmark NFTs will offer new property rights that traditionally have not existed. ""NFT technology offers the ability to add new information to a token without compromising the existing information.  Using NFT technology, a historical building can be digitized and keep its original history, while allowing new information to be added to its history so it will record its evolving history in real time. Buyers are no longer passive collectors. They become active partners and contributors to the content of those tokens and to the evolving history and legacy of the building,"" Wu explains.
For

All proceeds, from its partners' sale of NFTs, will be used to refurbish and restore

until the building is fully preserved.

If youre new to the world of crypto, figuring out how to buy Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies can be confusing at first. Thankfully, its pretty simple to learn the ropes. You can start investing in cryptocurrency by following these five easy steps.
1. Choose a Broker or Crypto Exchange
To buy cryptocurrency,first you need to pick a broker or a crypto exchange. While either lets you buy crypto, there are a few key differences between them to keep in mind.
What Is a Cryptocurrency Exchange?
A cryptocurrency exchangeis a platform where buyers and sellers meet to trade cryptocurrencies. Exchanges often have relatively low fees, but they tend to have more complex interfaces with multiple trade types and advanced performance charts, all of which can make them intimidating for new crypto investors.
Some of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges are Coinbase,Gemini and Binance.US While these companies standard trading interfaces may overwhelm beginners, particularly those without a background trading stocks, they also offer user-friendly easy purchase options.
The convenience comes at a cost, however, as the beginner-friendly options charge substantially more than it would cost to buy the same crypto via each platforms standard trading interface. To save on costs, you might aim to learn enough to utilize the standard trading platforms before you make your fist crypto purchaseor not long after.
An important note: As someone new to crypto, youll want to make sure your exchange or brokerage of choice allows fiat currency transfers and purchases made with U.S. dollars. Some exchanges only allow you to buy crypto using another crypto, meaning youd have to find another exchange to buy the tokens your preferred exchange accepts before you could begin trading crypto on that platform.
What Is a Cryptocurrency Broker?
Cryptocurrency brokers take the complexity out of purchasing crypto, offering easy-to-use interfaces that interact with exchanges for you. Some charge higher fees than exchanges. Others claim to be free while making money by selling information about what you and other traders are buying and selling to large brokerages or funds or not executing your trade at the best possible market price. Robinhood and SoFi are two of the most well-known crypto brokers.
While theyre undeniably convenient, you have to be careful with brokers because you may face restrictions on moving your cryptocurrency holdings off the platform. At Robinhood and SoFi, for instance, you cannot transfer your crypto holdings out of your account. This may not seem like a huge deal, but advanced crypto investors prefer to hold their coins in crypto wallets for extra security. Some even choose hardware crypto wallets that are not connected to the internet for even more security.
2. Create and Verify Your Account
Once you decide on a cryptocurrency broker or exchange, you can sign up to open an account. Depending on the platform and the amount you plan to buy, you may have to verify your identity. This is an essential step to prevent fraud and meet federal regulatory requirements.
You may not be able to buy or sell cryptocurrency until you complete the verification process. The platform may ask you to submit a copy of your drivers license or passport, and you may even be asked to upload a selfie to prove your appearance matches the documents you submit.
3. Deposit Cash to Invest
To buy crypto, youll need to make sure you have funds in your account. You might deposit money into your crypto account by linking your bank account, authorizing a wire transferor even making a payment with a debit or credit card. Depending on the exchange or broker and your funding method, you may have to wait a few days before you can use the money you deposit to buy cryptocurrency.
Heres one big buyer beware: While some exchanges or brokers allow you to deposit money from a credit card, doing so is extremely riskyand expensive. Credit card companies process cryptocurrency purchases with credit cards as cash advances. This means theyre subject to higher interest rates than regular purchases, and youll also have to pay additional cash advance fees.For example, you may have to pay 5% of the transaction amount when you make a cash advance. This is on top of any fees that your crypto exchange or brokerage may charge; these can run up to 5% themselves, meaning you might lose 10% of your crypto purchase to fees.
4. Place Your Cryptocurrency Order
Once there is money in your account, youre ready to place your first cryptocurrency order. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies to choose from, ranging from well-known names like Bitcoinand Ethereumto more obscure cryptos like Theta Fuel or Holo.
When you decide on which cryptocurrency to purchase, you can enter its ticker symbolBitcoin, for instance is BTCand how many coins youd like to purchase. With most exchanges and brokers, you can purchase fractional sharesof cryptocurrency, allowing you to buy a sliver of high-priced tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum that otherwise take thousands to own.
The symbols for the 10 biggest cryptocurrenciesbased on market capitalization* are as follows:

Others, such as Flow, are closed systems. For instance, you cant buy NBA Topshot NFTs (that are based on Flow) with etheror BNB.

Signing up
Signing up to an NFT marketplace can differ slightly from site to site, but the main steps to follow involve creating an account or connecting a supported digital wallet, or doing both. The button for this is typically located in the top right-hand corner of the NFT marketplace homepage. When connecting your wallet, you will be asked to enter your wallet password to complete the process.
Buying an NFT
NFTs are usually purchased directly for a fixed price or through an auction. In some cases, prospective buyers can submit offers to the owner and attempt to negotiate a better price.
Selling an NFT
Selling unique digital assets can be a more technically complicated process than buying them, particularly if the user is attempting to sell something they have created themselves (artwork, a soundtrack, a tweet, etc.).
You will need to upload the chosen digital asset onto the marketplace and enter a fixed price or opt to sell the NFT via an auction.
Next, the platform will verify the asset. If approved, it will be listed for sale.
When the seller accepts a bid, the marketplace conducts the transfer from buyer to seller.
Minting an NFT
If you want to create an NFT, you may consider starting with Ethereum, because its the largest system for these types of assets. You will need to have an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-721(Ethereums token standard for NFTs), such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet. Also, you will have to top up your wallet with about $50-$100 worth of etherto cover transaction fees (depending on how congestedthe network is).
Once you have completed those steps, you will be able to access and use platforms such as OpenSea, Rarible or Mintable. Most platforms have a Create button in the top right corner that will take you to the page where you can begin minting your NFTs.

On Monday digital currency asset manager Grayscale Investments Digital Large Cap (GDLC) fund officially became the third Grayscale product to transition into a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company. Its bitcoin (GBTC) and ether (ETHE) products received such designations in January 2020and October 2020respectively.
ADVERTISEMENT
The firm also filed forms for three other funds to become SEC-reporting: Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG), and Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC).
As an SEC reporting fund, GDLC will file reports and financial statements as 10-Qs and 10-Ks with the SEC, in addition to current reports on form 8-K. The fund will essentially report as if it were a publicly traded company  complete with quarterly reports, annual reports, audited financial statements and all other obligations under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (The Exchange Act). The new status also means that accredited investors who purchase shares in private placement rounds will have their mandated holding period cut in half, from 12 months to 6 months.
We hold our products to a higher standard because this is what investors want and what we believe they deserve, Craig Salm, Vice President of Legal at Grayscale Investments said. Events such as the Fund becoming our third SEC reporting company, and the additional Form 10 filings, signal that there is continued investor interest in gaining exposure to the growing digital currency ecosystem within existing regulatory frameworks, and that regulators continue to engage with market participants in the asset class.
The Grayscale Digital Large Cap fund has $348.2 million assets under management, making it Grayscales fourth largest product.Shares of the large cap fund are publicly quoted on an over-the-counter market, OTCQX, under the ticker GDLC. However, despite the name it is important to note that each GDLC share is 67.5% bitcoin and 25.3% ether, with a mix of cardano, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and chainlink holdings making up the balance.. This composition is reflected in its price performance over the past year, which closely tracks that of bitcoin.

So what
Why is that? A couple of news items are weighing on the major cryptocurrencies today, and they begin in Israel.
As Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports this morning, Israel is cracking down on the use of cryptocurrency to fund Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by both the U.S. and the European Union. According to the paper, Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing, an arm of the Defense Ministry, last month seized 70-plus digital wallets that it says were ""linked to Hamas."" Each of the three major cryptocurrencies named above -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin -- were seized in the operation.
Two implications follow from this news: First, and most obviously, Israel appears to be joining the slate of nations (which already include
China, the U.K., and the U.S.
) taking a dim view of cryptocurrency use. The more antipathy for cryptocurrency grows among nation states, the less attractive crypto may turn out to be for investment.
And second, coming on the heels of last month's news that the FBI successfully tracked and seized 63.7 Bitcoins that had been paid as ransom to the Colonial Pipeline hackers it's becoming increasingly clear that cryptocurrency transactions aren't quite as ""anonymous"" as they've been advertised to be -- nor crypto as safe to hold as it was once thought to be.
Now what
As Haaretz observes, legislators in the U.S. are looking at regulating cryptocurrency to strip away anonymity from digital wallets even further. And as worries loom about the future for crypto cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk warns in an article today that a ""bearish crossover"" looms for Bitcoin in particular.
This currency is already ""in a lull,"" warns CoinDesk, ""locked in a narrow range of $32,000 to $35,000 for more than two weeks,"" and potentially poised to move lower. Granted, that argument appears based on technical analysis -- a kind of stock price prognostication that we don't put a whole lot of faith inhere at The Motley Fool. On the other hand, the regulatory moves to restrict trading in cryptocurrency in China, in the U.K., in the U.S., and now in Israel, too -- are factual developments. They'll have real-world effects on the value of cryptocurrency going forward.

Ethereum is the next largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Because of the issues that China is having with Bitcoin more people are turning to Ethereum to gain exposure to the crypto market. Plus, Ethereum not only did well after Bitcoin topped, but it led the charge for other cryptos to rally higher.
Unfortunately though, it has not been able to sidestep the widespread pain in cryptocurrencies. From peak to trough, its now seen a decline of about 50%. However, it is still up about 200% for the year. So there are pros and cons.
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum continues to hold a key area on the downside. In the latters case, that comes into play around $1,950. The 200-day moving average also remains in play as support.
Weve seen a few moves below this area, but on a closing basis, Ethereum continues to hold $1,950. From here, lets see if Ethereum can find support from its short-term moving averages. On the upside, lets see if shares can take out the 10-week moving average. Above it puts $2,500 and the 50-day moving average in play, followed by $2,900.
If support doesnt hold up, we may see the $1,950 area retested. Below $1,950 puts the key $1,730 mark on the table, while a move below $1,730 could create a big flush lower into a new buy zone.

") and Ethereum) designed to directly compete with Ethereum. As a result, investors tend to push Cardano up when Ethereum rises, and vice versa.

In the past several months Cardano has been in a slump. As of July 10, Cardano is at around $1.33, after a May 15 peak of $2.4618. That is a loss of $1.0868.
This means it has dropped 45% from its former peak If Cardano can recover half of this fall (i.e., 54.34 cents), that means theres potential upside of 41% (i.e., $0.5434 / $1.33 = 0.409). And there is every reason to believe that this could happen, especially if Ethereum recovers.
For one, Cardano has already had a great return this year. It ended last year at just 17.4 cents per ADA token. So that means it is still up $1.156, or 564% (i.e., $1.156/0.174 -1 = 5.64). It is one of the best-performing cryptos in 2021.
In addition, this performance also coincides with Ethereums moves up. As of July 10, Ethereum is at $2,096.82. It ended last year at $730.37. So that means its 2021 performance is up 187% (i.e., $2,097/$730 -1 = 1.87).
That means that Cardano has outperformed Ethereum by 3 times (i.e., 564%/187% = 3). So I expect that once Ethereum begins to recover it will move Cardano substantially higher. The delta or change in upside is greater than 1.0, implying that ADA tokens will outperform ETH token prices.
Where This Leaves ADA Now
The goal of Cardano as a decentralized blockchain platform is to allow smart contractsto run much faster and smoother. These are essentially software-coded apps built on a blockchain platform where no company holds the data provided to the app. The decentralized blockchain keeps the information. So they are called Dapps (decentralized applications).
Ethereum is ahead of Cardano in that it already has many smart contracts applications, as Dapps or DeFi (decentralized finance) apps. Some recent estimates are that there are 5.42 million ETH tokens locked up in one Ethereum staking contract alone This represents over $11.36 billion in value just for this contract. Cardano is behind the curve. Once its blockchain accepts smart contracts, it could gain a significant market share.
Cardano is now very close to rolling out its next phase of
software development called the Alonzo testnet
. This rollout is actually the last part of the third phase of its development known as the Goguen phase. That is when it will issue smart contracts and native blockchains. (The Goguen phase is named after computer scientist Joseph Goguen)
The Alonzo introduction of smart contracts is expected to start in August 2021. This should also help with the popularity of the ADA token since it will allow Cardano blockchains to compete against Ethereums smart contracts.
Cardano is laying the groundwork for a major push into smart contracts. For example, recently the Cardano Foundation, based in Switzerland, revealed its five-year game plan It seeks to target banks and Fortune 500 companies to introduce them to the benefits of Cardanos blockchain system vs. Ethereum.
It wants 50 banks to allow ADA tokens to be converted into local currency and vice versa. This will expose the legacy financial institutions to the benefits of blockchain technology.
What to Do With Cardano Crypto Now
On March 19, Coinbase (NASDAQ:
COIN
), the largest crypto exchange, began to allow Cardanos ADA tokens to tradeon its exchange. In addition, recently Webull, a commission-free brokerage firm like Robinhood, began to allow Cardano to be traded there Since Robinhood uses the same clearing agent as Webull, they may be open to allowing ADA to trade there soon as well. Cardano can also be bought on Binance USand other exchanges, so it is easily bought and sold.
As a result of its open access to investors, Cardano, the fifth largest crypto by market capitalization ($42.55 billion) should do well. It has a good chance of rebounding this year once Ethereum and Bitcoin begin to recover.

"Rare Diamond Sells For $12.3 Million In Cryptocurrency
Chalk up a new milestone for cryptocurrencies.
Sothebys auction house has announced that it sold a rare 101-carat diamond for $12.3 million U.S., and it was purchased using cryptocurrency.
The large, pear-shaped diamond sold for a greater than expected $12.3 million U.S. after the auctioneer announced that it was accepting auction bids in either Bitcoin or Ethereum (Ether), in addition to traditional forms of payment.
Sotheby's would not disclose which of the two cryptocurrencies had been used to make the purchase but said the full amount was being paid using digital coins.
The diamond, dubbed ""The Key 10138,"" went to an anonymous private collector, according to a Sothebys news release.
Sotheby's said the sale had attracted new clients well beyond the traditional pool of collectors, adding that cryptocurrency purchases appealed to a digitally savvy generation.
Remarkably rare, the diamond was the second largest pear-shaped diamond ever to come to market, according to Sotheby's. It was one of only 10 diamonds of its quality weighing over 100 carats ever to appear at auction.
Several auction houses have begun welcoming cryptocurrencies for big-ticket items, which have included paintings and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The blockchain-backed tokens are increasingly used to transfer ownership of digital artworks and collectibles.
Earlier this year, Sotheby's opened the sale of Banksy's Love is in the Air artwork to payment via Bitcoin and Ethereum. The famed artwork, which depicts a masked man throwing a bouquet of flowers like a Molotov cocktail, eventually sold for $12.9 million U.S., though the auction house did not reveal whether they buyer eventually used a cryptocurrency.

"Countdown to the (re) evolution of Ethereum that will catapult ether again
'London' update paves the way for Ethereum 2.0
The highly anticipated London update of the Ethereum network is getting closer and closer. Last week, the developers of the blockchain on which smart contracts are deployed and the majority of DeFi (for the acronym in English of decentralized finance) carried out various tests for the improvements of the algorithm that will be completed on August 4, date announced for release. Analysts expect this event as a true milestone for ether - the native unit of this network - which has the potential to serve as a price catalyst. In addition, it leaves the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization ready for its authentic revolution.
The ether rallied this week after the falls of the past and has been consolidating the 2,000 dollars for some time, after a round trip that took it to the record on May 12, 2021 around 4,200 dollars. Then the selling pressure pushed it back to $ 1,700 towards the end of May and also in June. Despite the abysmal price difference with bitcoin, which trades around $ 33,000, more and more analysts and market participants are very bullish on this token, which currently has a capitalization of $ 253bn, about 19% of the total of the cryptoactive market, compared to the number one 'crypto', which maintains a 44% dominance.
In fact, analysts as reputable as those of Goldman Sachs believe that it will end up surpassing the creation of Satoshi Nakamoto and there are not a few who lend its uses beyond the speculative aspect. It is used to ""feed"" the Ethereum network, which is essentially a decentralized software platform, designed to run compiled computer code known as a smart contract. These smart contracts can be used to automate a wide range of functions, from very simple value exchanges, through insurance contracts to the processing of the activity of decentralized exchanges, which are managed by the decentralized network of Ethereum.
The complexity of the smart contract sets the transaction fees that are quoted in ether (known as gas fees). In this way, the price fluctuates depending on whether the transactions have a high economic value, since people are willing to pay more for the transactions.
In addition to this, ether has also obtained a certain status of ""safe haven"" asset in the crypto universe, they explain from Wisdom Tree. ""Because it is the second largest cryptocurrency, its demand is very constant and, although it is not fixed, the expansion of its supply is very predictable and relatively docile compared to the standards of traditional currencies after 2008,"" they argue.
In addition to the above, at the beginning of August, five Ethereum Enhancement Proposals (EIP) will be implemented, which includes the aforementioned 'London' optimization, among which EIP 1559 and EIP 3554 stand out, whose objective is to counteract various inefficiencies:
EIP 1559 introduces a new fee structure that makes Ethereum cheaper. This change in the protocol is very controversial because it aims to burn part of the tariffs and, therefore, reduce the income of the miners.
The EIP 3554 delays the Ethereum difficulty bomb until December 1. This mechanism will increase the difficulty of mining on the Ethereum network, effectively ""freezing"" the proof-of-work (POW) in preparation for Ethereum's move to version 2.0, which involves the proof-of-stake ( POS for its acronym in English), less polluting.
EHTEREUM 2.0, 99.5% LESS POLLUTING
But these improvements that London implies, are only a preliminary step for Ethereum 2.0, a true revolution that has the potential to catapult ether above bitcoin. Most importantly, the network will abandon traditional mining. That is, it will go from the Proof of Work (POW) protocol - solving mathematical problems to maintain the network - to the Proof of Stake (POS) protocol - based on criteria such as number of currency and time on the web- as a consensus mechanism. The POS is more environmentally friendly and sustainable: it will consume 99.5% less.
Second, Wisdom Tree analysts mention the development of second-tier solutions to improve network scaling. ""These changes are believed to help boost the use of the Ethereum network, allowing the platform to attract more users and projects,"" they say.
Furthermore, the potential switch to POS is generating intense debate in the crypto sector regarding energy use. The POS protocol consumes much less power than the POW and, as such, some speculate that this could favor the adoption of the platform.
""The launch of the new, more energy efficient Ethereum 2.0 network will popularize the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and make investment returns more attractive to both institutional and retail investors."" Bitpanda experts point out.

Read Full Story
Cryptocurrency exchange, CoinDCX, has launched a new token, Liqueth (LQTH), a bond-backed token based on a proof of stake (PoS) reserve protocol that aims to make staking accessible for Indian crypto community. Staking is the process a wallet uses to validate transactions and award the node that adds a new block of transactions to the blockchain.
Liqueth will allow users to earn staking rewards backed by ETH or Ethereum 2.0.
As a tokenized asset, LQTH will be generated and transferred to stakers in a 1:1 ratio for every ETH staked through CoinDCX. LQTH is an ERC-20 token and will only be minted once the ETH locked in CoinDCX is sent for validator creation.
The company will cover all validator operating expenses, and 100% of the on-chain staking rewards will be distributed to users in the form of ETH.
CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX Sumit Gupta, said: We want to make staking very simple and accessible for our users, which is why we are providing an ETH staking facility to anyone who holds at least 0.1 ETH in their CoinDCX wallet. Ultimately, we believe that this will allow our users to unlock the full earning potential of digital assetsby more actively participating in the token economy and the DeFi space, as we move further and further away from cryptocurrencys role as a speculative investment.""
The Ethereum network is one of the largest and most widely used public, open-source blockchain networks in the world that was built to allow developers to create and deploy decentralized applications using smart contracts.
ETH 2.0 is the long-awaited upgrade to the Ethereum network that promises to improve the networks scalability, speed, efficiency, and sustainability without sacrificing security and decentralization. The minimum amount of ETH required to stake directly on the ETH network to earn rewards is 32 ETH.
The current deposit contract for ETH 2.0 works only one wayusers can only deposit ETH but will not be able to withdraw it until ETH 2.0 is completely launched, which might take a few years. We aim to lower the barriers to staking by providing a highly liquid, smart-contract-driven solution. Since the announcement of ETH 2.0, while many aspire to participate in staking, only a few holds the minimum required 32 ETH or possess adequate knowledge for setting up the system,"" said Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder, CoinDCX.

Bitcoin has taken the world by storm, setting the bar for all cryptocurrencies to follow. Inspiring a legion of new currencies, many have begun to note what these altcoins have to offer. Two of the most common being Ether, which provides features that extend far beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin and Litecoin, a compliment of the original cryptocurrency.
Below, we'll examine these two critical digital currencies and why they might be worthwhile investments. To start, let's look at this guide to Ethereum
Introduction to Ethereum
Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is based on a distributed public ledger. But that is where the similarities end. Bitcoin offers one application of blockchain technology, a peer-to-peer cash system known as Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network tracks its digital currency ownership, whereas Ethereum has become known for its smart contracts innovation A smart contract is a computer code that can help facilitate the exchange of any asset such as money, content or property. When placed on the blockchain, the smart contract becomes a self-operating program that automatically executes when parties meet the code's specified conditions. Other use cases are evident on the ""Ethereum Virtual Machine"" (EVM), a platform capable of running smart contracts that can execute bets, wagers and even employment contracts.
Ethereum's ability to facilitate these transactions is genuinely unique since while all blockchains can process code, their functions don't extend much farther. Developers can use this platform to create whatever operations they want, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO's) and decentralized applications (dApps). dApps are standalone applications that utilize smart contracts and run on the EVM. Common examples include micro-payment platforms, online gambling apps and entire peer-to-peer marketplaces. Like smart contracts, dApps run without the need of a central authority or overseer.
Ether is one of many new assets that are available on the Ethereum platform. More blockchain enthusiasts have created tokens that represent assets such as real estate, art or fiat currencies. These uses prove that Ethereum is on its way to becoming a fully developed distributed computing platform that is home to future innovations and new markets.
The crypto community holds Ethereum in high regard for its platform uses. However, another altcoin has recently taken the world by storm for its ability to conduct peer-to-peer transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin. Consider another valuable cryptocurrency in this brief guide to Litecoin
Introduction to Litecoin
Litecoin was one of the first altcoins. Although very similar to Bitcoin, the coin doesn't offer the same building platformas Ethereum but is still seen by many as valuable. Here's why.
Litecoin is peer-to-peer, facilitating transactions for no cost anywhere around the world but in a way that is ""faster and lighter"" than Bitcoin. Hence the term. The public knows the coin as the silver to Bitcoin's gold. It also shares another similarity with Bitcoin. The creators of Litecoin built the coin on Bitcoin's open-source codebase only with minor technological differences including:
Using the same Proof of Work (PoW) concept as Bitcoin but with an SHA-256 algorithm called Scrypt.
Being among the first cryptocurrencies to implement Lightning and SegWit.
The other significant difference isn't technological. It involves each cryptocurrency's creator. While Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto is still anonymous, the creator of Litecoin is still well-known in the cryptocurrency community and continues to participate actively in it. Charlie Lee continues to guide future iterations of Litecoin in alignment with the original vision. Lee is currently helping to lead the upgrade for Segregated Witness (SegWit), a foundation that will allow transaction data to be stored more efficiently. With SegWit, Litecoin can also scale future innovations through Lightning Networks.
Although the liquidity is less than Bitcoin, the coin can still be easily exchanged into fiat currency or used on cryptocurrency marketplaces for exchange.
Looking to the Crypto Community
Blockchain scratches the surface with Bitcoin. Therefore, this could be the year that many altcoins hit the mainstream crowd. As people begin exploring altcoins and the problems they are hoping to solve, it will only be a matter of time before these currencies skyrocket in value. Many investors who missed the Bitcoin bandwagon believe it might not be too late to invest in these other tokens. Consider that Amazon, Tesla or any other large organizations all typically follow each other in pricing. Could it be so unreasonable that the crypto industry would do the same?

ETH/USD continues to move near important support levels as speculators wonder if the mid-term slump will remain durable.

ETH/USD remains near important mid-term support levels as the cryptocurrency finds it difficult to gather any type of steady momentum upwards. Trading volumes remain rather light also within ETH/USD as speculators try to decipher technical charts and perhaps await impetus to suddenly emerge. As of this morning, ETH/USD remains within sight of 2150.00, and this is likely not bringing comfort to bullish traders who have stubbornly pursued higher values.

of July and, its current value, while not sitting on top of these prices, remains close enough to these junctures to serve as a reminder. Current resistance appears to be relatively close around 2186.00, and ETH/USD can still move quickly so this level could be tested quickly. However, the 2200.00 mark may become an important psychological hurdle if it is not toppled soon. If the price of ETH/USD consolidates beneath this resistance barrier, traders may believe another leg down could materialize.
Support is close to the 2100.00 level as of this writing and if this juncture begins to see a real test, bearish traders may believe the 2060.00 mark will demonstrate another test sooner rather than later. Traders looking for signals from this past weekend should acknowledge that volumes were low and the prices within the broad cryptocurrency market were rather tame. The lack of wild volatility as many cryptocurrencies continue to hover near important mid-term support needs to be contemplated.
While support levels around current price vicinities have proven to produce polite reversals higher, speculators who believe the tone of the ETH/USD market remains bearish may believe opportunities lurk via selling positions. If ETH/USD fails to break above the 2200.00 level, traders may be tempted to sell on rises which come within sight of current resistance and then short Ethereum.

"Fed flags crypto assets for first time in Financial Risk Review
New Delhi: Major cryptocurrencies were trading higher on Monday after a tepid weekend trade. The digital token market cheered the absence of any negative news flow after a jittery week. The crypto market jumped as much as 6 per cent from the previous day, with eight out of the top 10 digital currencies trading higher at 9.30 hours IST.
The Federal Reservesingled out a surge in crypto asset prices for the first time in its overall assessment of the stability of the financial system, saying the rise reflected increased risk-taking by investors.
Cryptocurrency company Bullish announced on Friday it had agreed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a merger with Far Peak Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (
SPAC
), in a $9 billion deal. The unit of blockchain software company Block.one, plans to launch a regulated crypto exchange later this year.
""It was a pretty silent weekend in the cryptocurrency markets. Major cryptocurrencies remained consolidated. Both, Bitcoin and Ethereum have defended their crucial support levels. Crypto traders would be looking for any cues regarding the momentum in the markets,"" said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder, Mudrex.
""As long as the markets make a move on either side, traders would quickly jump on the bandwagon and tip the scales. Long-term investors would, however, be pretty excited because of the consolidation seen in the past few days. Such consolidations generally pave the way for a quick pump and push the markets higher,"" he added.
Financial payments startup Square is trying to make a real-world wallet for safely pocketing bitcoin cryptocurrency. Square founder and chief Jack Dorsey, who is also the top executive at Twitter, had tweeted last month asking for feedback on the notion.
Tech View by Siddharth Menon COO WazirX
Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin price
action is making higher lows from 26th July 2021, which may be a sign of potential trend reversal. Bitcoin broke out of the descending triangle pattern and the RSI shows the uptick which indicates that a buying momentum is building up.
RSI breakout above the trendline may be a confirmation of trend reversal if the price closes above the resistance of $41,273 on the daily timeframe, whereas a breach of $29,898 level may take Bitcoin towards $20,000-25,000 levels.
Ethereum
Ethereum continues to stay strong against Bitcoin as a result of which money is chasing Altcoins. DEFI and NFT sectors have started outperforming the market. SNXand SAND gained more than 50% last week.

th
July. Reversing a 1.53% gain from the previous week, Bitcoin ended the week at $34,244.0.
In a mixed start to the week, Bitcoin rose to a Monday intraweek high $35,280.0 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $37,017, Bitcoin slid to a Thursday intraweek low $32,063.0.
Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $33,117 before a partial recovery to $34,200 levels.
4 days in the red that included a 4.55% slide on Monday delivered the downside for the week.
For the week ahead
Bitcoin would need to avoid the $33,862 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $35,662.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $35,000 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $36,000 would likely cap any upside.
In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at $38,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $37,079.
A fall through the $33,862 pivot would bring the first major support level at $32,445 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$30,000 levels. The second major support level at $30,645 should limit the downside.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.02% to $34,237.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $34,360.0 before falling to a low $34,051.0.
Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested at the start of the week.

After a bearish start to the week, Ethereum rose to a Wednesday intraweek high $2,411.19 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $2,489, Ethereum slid to a Friday intraweek low $2,050.00.
Story continues
Finding support at the first major support level at $2,057, Ethereum revisited $2,190 levels before easing back.
4-days in the red that included an 8.63% tumble on Thursday delivered the downside for the week.
For the week ahead
Ethereum would need to move through the pivot at $2,201 to bring the first major resistance level at $2,351 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $2,300 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.
In the event of an extended breakout, Ethereum could test the second major resistance level at $2,562. Ethereum would need plenty of support, however, to breakout from last weeks high $2,411.19.
Failure to move through the pivot at $2,201 would bring the first major support level at $1,990 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off in the week, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$1,900 levels. The second major support sits at $1,839.
At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.39% to $2,149.22. A mixed start to the week saw Ethereum fall to an early morning low $2,126.69 before rising to a high $2,150.77.

A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning intraday low $2,081.51 before making a move.
Finding support at the first major support level at $2,059, Ethereum rallied to a late intraday high $2,173.37.
Coming within range of the first major resistance level at $2,177, Ethereum eased back to end the day at sub-$2,150 levels.
At the time of writing, Ethereum was down by 0.40% to $2,132.28. A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum rise to an early morning high $2,142.63 before falling to a low $2,126.69.
Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
For the day ahead
Ethereum would need to avoid a fall back through the $2,132 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $2,182 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from Sundays high $2,173.37.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.
In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at $2,250 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $2,224.
A fall back through the $2,132 pivot would bring the first major support level at $2,090 into play.
Barring an extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$2,000 levels. The second major support level at $2,040 should limit the downside.

"Smooth Love Potion Price is Surging Here is Why
By
Alyssa Exposito
Jul. 13 2021, Published 3:11 p.m. ET
Smooth Love Potion (SLP) are ERC-20 tokens and the in-game currency in Axie Infinity These tokens are minted after gameplay and rewarded to players as a means to breed more digital pets, aka axies. Axies are non-fungible tokens (NFT's) and can be bought, bred, sold, and traded. As the game continues its exponential growth, its in-game tokens surge in price.

As the price of SLP continues to rise, so do the value of the axies as it takes a certain amount of Smooth Love Potionto breed them. Like any other ecosystem, the more it grows, the more resources are needed to maintain it. However, to avoid hyperinflation, there is a cap on the number of times one can breed their axies before they are sterile. Most players earn their SLP by playing the game's daily quest and because of this many players in countries facing economic hardship have increased their interest and usage.

With its launch this past May, Ronin an Ethereum side chain, increased user play because it eliminated high transaction fees.

"If youre new to the world of cryptocurrencies, learning each digital currencies can be dizzying. With how volatile crypto investing can be, choosing a solid investment is easier said than done. However, with a bit of research and studying experts analysis, you can narrow down a few reliable cryptocurrencies to invest innot sure bets, but more stable projects. One of those is Uniswap (UNI).Uniswap, like many other cryptocurrencies, has had a relatively good year. Although UNI has been down recently, it might be a better investment than other cryptocurrencies. But before you throw all of your money into UNI, its best to understand the crypto and how it works so you know if its the right project for you to invest in.What is Uniswap?Uniswap is the most popular decentralized application (DAPP) on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap is the seventh-largest digital asset with a market capitalization of about $11 billion.Uniswap is an automated liquidity provider that makes it easy to exchange Ether tokens. There isn't a centralized facilitator. Instead, tokens are exchanged through liquidity pools that are procured by smart contracts.Uniswap solves the problem of crypto exchanges absorbing too much power by creating a decentralized trading platform. It uses Ethereums blockchain to process these transactions. Many cryptocurrencies and NFTs utilize Ethereums blockchain and smart contract system. Smart contracts enable DAPPs to facilitate protocols on Ethereums blockchain, and Uniswap is one of those decentralized apps.Uniswap is a group of smart contracts that work in sync as a decentralized crypto exchange. Because Uniswap works on the Ethereum blockchain, it has the same decentralized and global capabilities that cryptocurrencies have. Uniswaps smart contracts are capable of transferring money autonomously and efficiently without governmental regulations and oversight.Is Uniswap a good investment?At the beginning of 2021, UNI was trading at $5.17. However, UNI rode the same wave as every cryptocurrency through the first quarter and most of the second quarter and reached a peak of $45.02 in early May.The recent market downturn didnt spare Uniswap. While UNI is currently trading around $18 per token, its still over three times higher than it was at the beginning of the year. UNI has maintained similar trajectories as Ether, which is to be expected since Uniswap runs on the same blockchain.Uniswap as a long-term investment isnt a bad strategy. Ethereums smart contract system provides it with a lot of utilization well into the future. As Ethereum takes offespecially after Ethereum 2.0 rolls outits smart contracts will as well. Uniswap is poised to benefit from the same momentum as Ethereum.However, the future of the cryptocurrency market still isn't clear. Some governments have embraced decentralized finance projects, while others have been taking a more hardline approach. With such mixed feelings from global powers, its difficult to say confidently whether certain cryptocurrencies like Uniswap are a good long-term investment.",2021-07-13,0.9984,0.204,0.018,0.778

NFTs are all the rage so in turn it greatly affects the value of domain names. Write about NFTs what they are and write about how overnight the owner of NFT.com, and anyone with a catchy NFT domain is in the money.
NFTs. The digital asset that has celebrities like Elon Musk and his wife Grimes, Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and more joining the crypto art craze. We keep hearing about them on the news, in pop culture and online articles. But, what are they really?
Are NFTs just a short lived craze? Or will they shift the world of investing forever? In this article Saw.com will answer your questions about NFTs; what they are, why you should care and how they could affect the domain industry.
What is an NFT?
Put simply, an NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, is a unique digital asset.They represent real life objects like art, music, videos and in-game objects. However, they are bought and sold online, and many times purchased using cryptocurrency. Most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain, an open sourced blockchain.
A NFT can not be replaced with something else, because they have distinctive properties. An example of a non-fungible object is The Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. If you traded it for another painting, you would have something completely different. There is nothing that compares and can be traded equally for The Mona Lisa.
Some characteristics of NFTs include:
Each non-fungible token has a unique identifier
Each token has a creator and an owner. It is easy to verify yourself as either the creator or owner.
NFTs are not interchangeable with other tokens. Each is completely unique.
NFTs are based on Ethereum.
They can be sold through an NFT market like Ethereum or sold from consumer to consumer.
NFTs are not to be confused with a fungible token, like the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator. It can be sent from user to user through bitcoin network without the need for an intermediary. Furthermore, there is no difference between two Bitcoins, they are like two United States one dollar bills. Interchangeable, physically identical and worth the same amount.
Examples of NFTs
Charlie Bit My Finger, Nyan Cat GIF, CryptoKitties and NBA shots are just a few examples of recently sold NFTs. Although most often associated with digital art, NFTs can apply to any product online. And they are truly taking the digital world by storm. One NFT, Beeples Everydays: The First 5000 Days, sold for a whopping $69 million dollars this year.
Some examples of NFTs include: unique digital artwork, a video, gifs, an essay, digital collectible, a video game item, designer sneakers, an online ticket for an event and a domain name. However, NFTs are still so new. Because they include anything that is unique and requires individual proof of ownership, in the future there could be much more that is identified as an NFT.
NFTs and Domain Names
As the interest in NFT investments rise, there will be more and more websites handling the transaction of NFTs. Thus causing an increased need for NFT related domain names. Domain company, Donuts, monthly market report of trending keywords reported a huge spike of domains containing NFTs in March and April in 2021.
Some of these domain names were registered by investors, but some buyers were companies who sell NFTs. Common keywords for NFT related domain names include

"is doing worst of all -- down 3.7%.
So what
Why is that? As we saw last week and as we saw yesterday the answer appears to be government regulation and action -- not just in the U.S. but around the world.
Image source: Getty Images.
In the United Kingdom, authorities just announced a ""significant"" operation to seize what they called laundered ""proceeds of crime"" in the form of cryptocurrency, according to CNN. In what the news organization is referring to as Britain's largest-ever seizure of cryptocurrency -- and one of the biggest seizures anywhere, ever -- London's Metropolitan Police confiscated $249 million worth of crypto (without divulging which kinds, specifically) allegedly linked to international money-laundering operations.
And although no one can fault authorities for investigating and confiscating any ill-gotten gains, the fact that police forces around the world are working to trace these funds suggests that crypto's untraceability and anonymity -- two big reasons why cryptocurrency got popular in the first place -- are now no longer assured.
Nor is the U.K. the only source of headaches for crypto traders. In South Korea, Reuters reports that a law passed in March will require cryptocurrency exchanges to ""partner with banks"" and obtain a ""security certificate"" from the government if they want to keep doing business. The more regulations government piles onto crypto, the less attractive it might be to users -- and the more expensive it will become.
Now what
Indeed, it seems traders' enthusiasm for cryptocurrency may already be waning. According to data from the largest crypto exchanges, trading volumes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and other forms of cryptocurrency""fell more than 40% in June,"" as CNBC reported yesterday.
""Half the market is gone,"" a crypto research analyst told CNBC. And with buyers now in scarce supply, there's less bidding to drive prices higher -- or even support them where they're at. Result: Cryptocurrency is now heading into the third month of a ""two-month correction period,"" according to CNBC. Since early May, for example, the value of Bitcoin has fallen 44%.

"Ethereums DeFi dominance
), expectations run high for Cardano. Many dived into it during the crypto bubble last spring, anticipating it seeing a tremendous rise in value in the coming years.
Yet, its high utility and potential wasnt enough to leave it unscathed after the big selloff in May. ADA-USD hit an all-time high of $2.46 on May 16. Since then? Its fallen nearly 45%. Fair weather investors who bought it for fast profits have cashed out. But investors with a longer time horizon may not want to throw in the towel.
Why? Because its Alonzo and Goguen upgrades could be the catalystthat sends it back toward its past high-water mark. Especially the Goguen upgrade, which is the one that will add smart contract capabilities to this altcoin rising star. With its enhancements going live in the next month, the slump Cardanos found itself in may give way to a solid rebound in its coin price.
Of course, its not guaranteed that ADA will rally from the $1.36 it trades for today, back up to $2.46. The above-mentioned challenges to the crypto market may mean its recovery will still take some time. But with it leveling up its utility, and making itself a more viable competitor to Ethereum, buying now may be one of the best moves you make in cryptos right now.
Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

Despite still being the most valuable crypto by market capitalization, much of the buzz around BTC-USD has tapered off lately. With slow transaction times lower DeFi utility, and of course the conversation about its carbon footprint this is no surprise.
Worse yet, it may be at risk of becoming the AOL of crypto,an argument made by a Bloomberg commentator a few months back. In other words, much like AOL was a first-mover that quickly became a dinosaur, so too could Bitcoin.
However, there is something big in the pipeline that could change all that: the Taproot upgrade This upgrade (the first one for BTC since 2017) is set to come online in November. Taproot includes many improvements. The most important one? Enhanced smart contract capabilities. With this in mind, it may no longer be set in stone that Ethereum will supplant itas the dominant cryptocurrency.
Instead, Taproot may be what gives Bitcoin a shot of becoming an Ethereum killer itself, grabbing a much larger share of the DeFi and decentralized application (dApp) space than it has now. And, in turn, what gets BTC-USD out of its slump, and back toward prior price levels. Trading for between $34,000 and $35,000 recently, now may be the time to buy, ahead of the improvements.
Cryptos:Dogecoin (DOGE-USD)
Source: shutterstock.com/Igor Igorevich
Is Dogecoin about to get serious? Its starting to look that way. Its still questionable whether Elon Musk would follow throughon his plans to help improve the utility of this meme coin. Even as his tweets on it have moved beyond just jokey takes and now discuss the nitty-gritty of leveling it up.
Right now, its the efforts of developer Patrick Lodderthat may be of most interest to those holding DOGE-USD. Namely, upgrades that will lower transaction fees and increase its scalability. Admittedly, these changes wont immediately turn it into a possible Ethereum killer. It still has its work cut out for it.
Musks involvement in its improvement remains a work-in-progress. But if he remains its main cheerleader (despite his tweets
not moving its price as much as they once did
), progress in its development could continue. If it all works out, and it fully moves beyond its jokecoin origins, it may give it a path to rebound, after its epic fall from nearly 74 cents, to around 22 cents today.
Yet, unlike with Cardano, Ethereum (more below), and the other cryptos with upgrades coming up fast, a Dogecoin recovery could take much more time. Keep it on your radar, but it may still be best to take your time before entering a position.
Ethereum Classic (ETC-USD)

ETC may have its fans. But its far behind in terms of usage (or market capitalization) compared to its better known counterpart, ETH, which forked off of it. ETH, or Ether (what the coin that powers Ethereum is called) may also be receiving more attention with regards to its aforementioned upgrades.
Yet, not to be left behind, Ethereum Classic, the original, has a major upgrade as well, thats going live later this month Known as the Magneto upgrades, this upgrade mainly implements the enhancements Ethereum implemented earlier this year, with its respective Berlin upgrade. Mostly, these improvements will bolster up security, as well as lower transaction fees.
Awareness of the pending upgrades may have helped ETC prices to rally in late June Should investors expect a similar reaction, once they go live on July 21? Not so fast. The widespread improvements seen with Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, and others may be what heralds a return to a bull market for cryptos.
But dont give your hopes up thinking that the Magneto upgrades will send Ethereum Classic (recently trading for around $49.50) back to the triple-digit price levels it traded for back in May. There may be potential for it to gain. Yet, as I put it on June 17, with so many fish in the DeFi sea, throw this one back
Cryptos:Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Will the upcoming improvements to Ethereum help move the price of its coin? Or, will it fail to move the needle? The 2.0 upgrades include many major changes.
For one, the move to proof-of-stakes, which will help speed up transaction times. In addition, it will bring down the high gas fees that have resulted in many turning to the Ethereum killers as alternatives. But some crypto market commentators are skeptical whether the changes will bring about increased usage and in turn, an increase in price for Ether (what the coin itself is called).
On the other hand, it seems far-fetched to think these changes wont help this blockchain, the most predominantly used in DeFi, maintain its lead over Cardano, Polygon (CCC:
MATIC-USD
), and other Ethereum killer front-runners. Not only that, allow it to make big progress in getting towards the so-called flippening, or the point in which it becomes more valuable than Bitcoin.
As InvestorPlaces William White reported July 9, analysts at Goldman Sachs already see it as the crypto with superior real-world use Once the 2.0 upgrades go into effect, we could see the sentiment around it continue to move in this more positive direction. That may not mean the flippening is within reach. Yet, it may mean Ether prices, at around $2,100 today, may have room to leap back above $3,000, or even above $4,000 per coin.
Neo (NEO-USD)

NEO-USD may be one of the more obscure cryptos. But as InvestorPlaces Tezcan Gecgil broke it down Jun 23, it may be good value at todays prices(around $34). Why? For now, due to many existing features, including smart contract capabilities.

Overall, however, crypto trading appears to have slowed down in recent weeks. Data company CryptoCompare said that trading volumes fell more than 40 per cent in June, amid uncertainty in the market.
Fears over increasing regulation in China continue to dampen interest in cryptocurrencies. In recent months, various official bodies have warned banks that they should not facilitate cryptocurrency transactions and personal investors that their holdings are not protected, and rumours have suggested that more regulation could be coming.
That has led the price of many cryptocurrencies to fall, too. In March and April, for instance, bitcoin was comfortably above $60,000, but over recent weeks its price has mostly traded at just over half that, with prices tending to stick at just above $30,000.

Bolstering the profit has been Ethers rising price.What is T-Rex Ether miner software?T-Rex is popular for cryptocurrency mining operations that use Nvidia equipment. It claims to apply unique techniques to use Nvidia graphics cards to their full potential.You can use T-Rex software on your personal computer or specially assembled rig to mine Ethereum. According to T-Rex, the software makes ETH mining faster and easier than on rival systems. The software also appeals to people joining mining pools to increase their profit. T-Rex says it uses the best speed in the pool and its stable because it offers many months of uptime.Why would you need T-Rex Ether miner?As a multi-algorithm software, T-Rex can be used to mine several cryptocurrencies in addition to Ethereum. You can use the software to mine Ravencoin, Ethereum Classic, and many other altcoins, making it easy to shift to coins that are more profitable to mine as prices change.Another major selling point for T-Rex is its low developer feesmost of its algorithms charge developers just 1 percent. Additionally, T-Rex claims to make mining control and monitoring easy.How to buy T-Rex Ethereum minerYou can download the software directly from the providers site, and run it on a Windows or Linux system.

But for miners, it wont be business as usual.Whereas Ethereum has been one of the most lucrative cryptocurrencies to mine, Ether mining may become obsolete in a not-so-distant future.

"/PRNewswire/ -- RedStone, the creator of a next-generation decentralized finance oracle platform has raised
$525K
in its pre-seed financing round. Led by Maven 11 Capital, major investors in the private-placement SAFT-style round included Arweave, Collider Ventures, KR1, 1kx, and Bering Waters Ventures.
The successful financing round is a new milestone on RedStone's journey to becoming the oracle platform of choice for users of decentralized finance (DeFi). Data oracles are a critical component of DeFi infrastructure that provide access to external data sources, such as coin pricing information, without the need for a central intermediary.
""
DeFi has experienced a colossal expansion, yet the oracle technology is lagging behind with the infrastructure created a few years ago. RedStone is looking to fill that gap by offering fast, cost-efficient and convenient tools for providing data to blockchain protocols. I'm privileged to be surrounded by a group of very experienced investors who can help Redstone to reach its full potential,
"" said
Jakub Wojciechowski
, CEO and founder of RedStone.
RedStone is a next-generation cross-chain data oracle technology that offers fast and cost-efficient access to data, a full historic audit trail and an insurance-backed decentralized dispute mechanism which provides users with recourse in the event that they receive inaccurate data. Today, RedStone supports 150 assets across three providers with oracle query interval times of up to ten seconds.
Some protocols store price data directly on transactional blockchains such as Ethereum. High gas fees associated with these types of public protocols represent a key challenge for many of today's oracles. Unable to pass these fees onto their users, oracles must instead subsidize their service by absorbing these costs, which is not a sustainable business model. In contrast, by leveraging Arweave, RedStone's storage costs are one million times lower than Ethereum, enabling it to provide a low-cost service to its customers based on a sustainable long term business model.
RedStone samples data sources and stores the information using Arweave's highly secure, low-cost decentralized storage infrastructure, providing a fully auditable historical audit trail of information.
""
Arweave provides permanent, on-chain storage that reaches extreme scale. That is why we are so excited about RedStone's work - they are unlocking the ability for decentralized oracles to process enormous amounts of data,
"" said
Sam Williams
, CEO of Arweave.
In the event that there is a dispute concerning the quality of data, the tamper proof historical record is consulted to confirm what data was originally supplied, and a decentralized governance mechanism then provides a ruling on the claim. The claimant then receives compensation from an insurance fund comprising the staked funds provided by RedStone's network participants.
The proceeds of the financing round, which was oversubscribed, will enable RedStone to continue to expand the partnerships with data providers and protocols that it supports. It will also enable Redstone to work towards the realization of its long term product roadmap which includes offerings such as cross-chain data bridges. In the future, owing to RedStone's unique flexible and cost-effective architecture, RedStone has the potential to address DeFi niches beyond simple price data such as providing information about trading volume, volatility and order-book structure.
ABOUT REDSTONE
RedStone is a next-generation cross-chain data oracle providing pricing data for financial protocols. It leverages the Arweave blockchain to create affordable storage with a permanent audit trail and provides an automatic dispute mechanism, backed with insurance through staking.
ABOUT ARWEAVE
Arweave
protocol enables a decentralized, permanent web upon which data is stored immutably and reliably. From data storage to app hosting, Arweave is rebuilding the social and technological infrastructure of the web, including the corporate structures behind the production of apps themselves.
This is made possible by Arweave's economic model based on an endowment rewarding those who store network data. Therefore, those who host their web apps on the Arweave network never have to worry about technical maintenance or ongoing hosting costs - once their code is deployed, it will persist forever. This allows developers to build applications that are owned and controlled by no person or company - just by their immutable code.

"Binance Coin Price Up By 5.12%  Time To Buy BNB?
Binance Coin Price Up By 5.12%  Time To Buy BNB?
Jimmy Aki
13, July 2021 | Last Updated: 13, July 2021
The Binance Coin (BNB) is backed by Binance, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. This fact may have encouraged investors to buy BNB over time.
The Binance cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most popular in the world. The platform is known for its low trading fees and has attracted a wide community of cryptocurrency traders.
BNB traded higher on Monday after a dull weekend alongside other major cryptocurrencies. In this article, we will explore the growth potential of the Binance Coin and determine if this is the right time to buy BNB.
Binance Coin Foremost Proprietary Coin
The Binance Coin is the fourth-largest crypto by market capitalization, behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoin Tether.
Binance was founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao.
BNB was initially created as a traditional ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network before the Binance blockchain was launched.
The coins are issued from the blockchain and secured by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism.
The Binance blockchain does not rely on the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, neither does it use smart contracts. Instead, it uses the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) and proof of authority (PoA).
Aside from serving as the native token of the Binance exchange, BNB is also the cryptocurrency that powers the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
BNB is used to fuel transactions on the BSC and pay transaction fees on the Binance exchange.
The coin also acts as the token that offers discounts for trading on Binances decentralized exchanges (Binance DEX) and its stand-alone DEX platform PancakeSwap.
67% of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.
BNB: Rallying Despite Market Downturn
BNB has gone through a significant price increase in 2021, which has encouraged more investors to buy BNB. The asset surged to an all-time high of $650 in early May.
However, it slumped soon after to $496.98 on 18 May and further to $283.45 the next day.
The asset is currently trading at $331.89, with its price jumping by 5.12% in the last 24 hours. If youre looking to buy BNB, now might be the perfect time to buy in on the action.
BNBs Technical And Fundamental Analysis
The BNB price on the chart is presently suggesting a bullish pattern. The assets relative strength index (RSI) is 41.88. This is a strong range that investors who want to buy BNB can still lock-in at.
BNBs 20-day moving average (MA) and 200-day MA prices are at $331.28 and $330, respectively. This signals a bearish trend that may turn bullish as the RSI indicator.
In terms of fundamentals, Binances founder recently disclosed that the firm plans to double its global compliance team by the end of 2021. In an open letter, Zhao said Binances international compliance team and advisory board have already grown by 500% since last year.
Zhaos announcement came as no surprise as the exchange has been dealing with regulatory pushbacks globally. The UKs financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, recently banned Binance from offering crypto derivatives to UK investors.
The firm is also facing similar cases in Japan and Thailand. Last month the Japanese Financial Services Agency issued a second warning to the trading platform to cease operation in the region.
In Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filed a criminal complaint with the Economic Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police (ECD) against Binance.
According to the regulator, Binance has continued to operate in Thailand without the necessary operational license.
Investors who want to buy BNB may have to consider the crackdown on Binances services and the firms attitude toward regulation.

"Fake Tesla, Apple stocks have started trading on blockchains
New Delhi: Major cryptocurrencies were trading lower on Tuesday after investors booked profits. The digital token market has been cautious recently, following negative news flow last week. Eight out of top-10 digital currencies were trading lower at 9.30 hours IST, declining as much as 8 per cent.
Trading volumes at major cryptocurrencyexchanges fell by more than 40 per cent in June, research showed on Monday, with a regulatory crackdown in China and lower volatility among the factors depressing activity.
Spot trading volumes fell 42.7 per cent to $2.7 trillion, with derivative volumes down 40.7 per cent to $3.2 trillion, London-based researcher CryptoCompare's data showed.
Overall activity in the markets have mellowed down a little over the past few days. On-chain metrics have also been sluggish. Many analysts are looking at this as the 'calm before the storm'.
BTC and most other digital assets fell on Monday as US traders were holding off awaiting Tuesday's inflation report. Trading volumes across major crypto assets have been on a downtrend over the past week, but there is hope that the much awaited June CPI report by the Fed out later today, will help rekindle markets, said ZebPay Trade Desk
For the first time, we have seen crypto markets behave in a similar fashion to traditional markets, where June-July typically have lower volatility and trading volumes as the summer cycle kicks in and traders are just generally not as active.
""The start of the earning season in the US is impacted by Fed's June inflation report, and that will play a significant part in the price action. Moreover, the upcoming Grayscaleunlockings, coupled with the Taproot upgrade, is likely to lead to an increased buying by wealthy investors and BTC whales,"" it added.

Cardano
(ADA) is one of the popular altcoins aiming to build an ecosystem similar to that of Ethereum ADA grew from $0.18 levels at the start of the year to as high as $2.3 mid-May before losing some of the gains in the last two months.
After the developers announced improvements in the blockchain including the ability to have smart contracts, the market sentiment for ADA has turned bullish. More than $30 billion ADA, about 72 per cent of circulating supply, is staked on the blockchain, setting the stage for a considerable price appreciation for the coin.
While bullish in the longer run, ADA might witness a pullback in the coming days. ADA has broken down an ascending channel recently which is fundamentally bearish. In the shorter term, ADA's Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has seen a bearish divergence that might last for a few days, confirming a pullback.
With support at $1.28 and $1.25, its downside may be limited even as it continues to exhibit further weakness. A stronger correction could however send it to $1.18 level. ADA has potential to break beyond $1.5 level in the mid-term.
Major Levels
Support: $1.28, $1.25, $1.18
Resistance: $1.39, $1.44, $1.56

"The global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 3.31% to $1.36 trillion on Monday night as prices of major cryptocurrencies slipped.
What happened:
Bitcoin
(CRYPTO: BTC) traded 3.13% lower at $33,103.26 over 24 hours. For the week, BTC has fallen 3.04%.
Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) declined 4.61% to $2,033.50 over 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down 9.45% over a seven-day trailing period.

While DOGE was down 0.62% against BTC, the Shiba Inu-themed coin rose 1.3% against ETH over 24 hours.
Revain (CRYPTO: REV), a token of the eponymous review platform, was the foremost gainer over 24 hours on Monday night.
REV traded 13.03% higher at $0.0077 at press time. Against BTC and ETH, REV was up 16.55% and 18.81%, respectively. For the week REV was down 2.46%.
OKB (CRYPTO: OKB), Axie Infinity (CRYPTO: AXS), and EOS (CRYPTO: EOS) were some other tokens in the green.
OKB traded 8.5% higher at $10.72, AXS was up 0.56% at $18.42 and EOS spiked 0.36% to $4.21 over 24 hours.
Why It Matters: Bitcoin was mostly muted on Monday as investors anticipated the release of U.S. consumer price index inflation numbers due on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency is seen as a hedge against inflation.
CPI rose at an annual rate of 5% in May, compared with a 4.2% rise recorded in April, as per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures released last month.
On-chain data analytics firm Glassnode noted in a report on Monday that there are early signs of miner recovery post the exodus from China.

Glassnode propounded that the recovery in Bitcoin hash rate and its speed will provide bearish or bullish clues.
As per the firm, the hash rate this week recovered from a peak-trough decline of 55% to near 39% decline.
Should this level hold and be representative, it would indicate that hash-power equivalent to around ~29% of the affected hash-power has come back online, said Glassnode.
This was construed in the report to have either been due to successful relocation of mining hardware from China or previously obsolete hardware finding a new lease on life.
Earlier in the month, it was reported that miners income has increasedthanks to an algorithm adjustment brought on by the cryptocurrency crackdownin China.

"ZRX
) decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol has been suspended after a vulnerability has been uncovered in its code, the projects team announced in a Medium post publishedon July 13.
Per the announcement, third-party security researcher samczsunwarned the 0x team about the vulnerability in the exchange smart contract and, after evaluating it, the team suspended the exchanges contract and the AssetProxy contracts.
The vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to fill certain orders with invalid signatures. The announcement reassures that one has exploited this vulnerability and no users have lost their funds. The only consequence is apparently a temporary suspension of the service:
Unfortunately, this also means the currently deployed 0x contracts cannot process trades and are unable to be used. A patched version of the Exchange contract  that we are confident fixes this vulnerability  and new AssetProxy contracts are being deployed to the Ethereum mainnet and we expect them to be ready to use later tonight.
Lastly, the team notes that the vulnerability is not contained in its ZRX token contract and that user funds are safe. They thanked the security researchers while inviting other white hat hackers to participate in 0xs bug bounty program:
We also want to extend our sincerest gratitude to samczsun. We continue to offer a generous bug bountyto white hat hackers and community members that identify potential vulnerabilities. 
As Cointelegraph reportedin October last year, ZRX was the first ERC20 token to be listed on the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange.
At the beginning of May, the Tron Foundation discloseda fixed vulnerability that could have crashed its blockchain.
