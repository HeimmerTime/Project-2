Can anyone comment what will happen to the weth holders and if they will get the hard fork tokens if the ethereum are held on matic network instead of ethereum,2021-08-02
This is a bad idea. You'll more than likely end up buying back in at a bad point which then results in reducing your position. Don't sell your ETH. Stake that half instead of selling.,2021-08-01
"Hi, Ethereum gas fees are needed to carry out any transaction on the ETHEREUM blockchain as they ensure your transactions goes through.  
The gas fees are subject to how busy the network is, like you did mention, it varies as seen in the price you noticed when trying to mint that nft.

For OpenSea, you can buy, sell and mint NFT artworks on that protocol. If just starting on Ethereum, I suggest you take time to visit [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)  to get better understanding of the chain as it got well-resourced materials for everyone to learn about the chain.

NB: every chain got its gas fee and this is what is paid to the miners (those that verifies the transactions) for every transaction, i.e from providing liquidity, minting tokens and buying tokens from launchpads and even in defi😋.",2021-07-25

"Ok thanks, yes did understand all that about ethereum network and mining 

So was wnadering what your experience is with gas fees with buying nfts

Iam looking at getting some nfts at floor price and hodling till some hype if possible

What range amni looking with the gas fee 

Ive seen $4.26 was the cheapest i have seen for a week 

Any thoughts",2021-07-26
"$4.26 for minting is good bargin, with the huge gas fee in the market, I have experienced a  $150 gas fee charge for NFT, which I had to let go, because I had no such money, and this is one of the reasons why L2 NFT projects are booming.",2021-07-29
"Haha i sore 1300 i was so shocked 

Today i was looking at opening more packs but, the gas fee is 12 dollars, so i was out of eth, and took to long to send some over, you cant excatly send small bits over either 

One idea iam thinking each week getting paid from work, buy eth swap into Pmon, and store that up so i can make one big transaction, as i learnt today doesnt matter how big the transaction is itll always cost the same, plus if the prive of PMON keeps going up may be able to do other things 

As they said on there website 1 pmon eqauls a booster pack, now 1 pmon equaled 48 dollars at there launch as to now its dropped nicely 

Is that ""layer 2"" does that have a crypto name eth 2 or soemthing 

What projects are booming on that can you name a few ? 

Iam guessing they can hold more transactions and fees are lower",2021-07-29
"L2 means Layer 2 infrastructure, like xDai, Matic and the rest.

your idea of DCA into PMON is good, honestly, It's good to hold these value tokens but I'm kinda into the yield farming aspect of the market and hence interested in how to make profits from my NFT tokens, but I have found a solution with FORM",2021-07-29
"Yes i have bought into poly matic and thats layer 2 eth ? 

All the same blockchain gamed can be on that to, regarding transactions gas fees etc, 

Still getting the terms but what is DCA = and FORM",2021-07-30
"Matic (polygon) is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum, that good as you can find some blockchain games on this blockchain, even BSC got some blockchain games too.

DCA means Daily Cost Averaging, its a term that suggest individuals buying into an asset over a period of time as this will ensure your average cost will be reduced.

While FORM is the native token for [Formationfi](https://formation.fi) , a smart yield farming protocol that incorporated different pools and ensures its holders are given the best returns as the protocol takes note of those high performing pools in the crypto-verse.",2021-07-30

Algo?,2021-05-22
"It's a trick question. They don't exist because Cardano doesn't have smart contracts, so you literally can't get yield on anything because none of it exists. It took Ethereum 6 years to get to where it is and its had smart contracts the entire time.",2021-05-22
Yes its a shitcoin and I have been holding since its 80 dollars yes I will make money from it and increase my BTC stake. But go ahead and love your shitcoins. At the end its only BTC that matters but make money while you can,2021-05-22
Ahh... interesting. Shows you how much of a noob I am. ;),2021-05-22
"The problem with Cardano is that it's all promises and always has been. I'm not saying they'll never have smart contracts, but even once they do release them, it's just getting started. You need thousands of developers building these systems for years before you see any sort of ecosystem form around them. So will Cardano be succesful? Way too early to tell. And honestly, the risk adjusted returns right now makes it not worth it imo. Cardano is worth 1/5th of Ethereum. So the most you could hope for is a 5x on Cardano if it succeeds in taking market dominance from Ethereum, and I think the odds of that happening are much smaller than 1/5. Probably something like 1/50 to 1/100 for the real risk adjusted returns. If Cardano was worth a few hundred million in mcap, then it would probably be a different calculus (albeit still a very risky one, considering I think Cardano basically has zero shot in my mind)",2021-05-22
Interesting. It kinda reminds me of the apple App Store (started it all and got established and set the bar) compared to Microsoft App Store (all promises and still lagging behind),2021-05-22
[deleted],2021-05-22
That is an interesting analogy that I like but maybe I have some bias toward apple.....oh and ETH,2021-05-22
"It's more like early days internet - Like when everyone was JUST getting online there were ALL these promising internet service providers and websites. Many, many, MANY, failed. Crypto CAN be useful. Like anything else, it's a tool. How well it's implemented and built out will determine how valuable it becomes.  


So a smart person would focus in on each one. When you have the extra cash, and you really understand something, THEN invest your money. Know what you're buying and understand who else is propping up the system.  


Most of our lives are smoke and mirrors but that doesn't mean it's not meaningful or based on something. Just study the history of these things and what they've done so far, keep a big picture perspective if you're invest for the long haul.",2021-05-22

"The great flippening 

https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/flippening/",2021-05-14
Bitcoin is only a store of value. It's like buying gold and letting it gain value. Ethereum has alot of everyday use. Crypto is just now in the first inning.. Ethereum is on deck. It's time will come. Or another coin thats better will take its place. But it's coming when crypto starts getting alot more everyday use,2021-05-14
"Yes it’s absolutely possible and personally I believe it will end up like that - though I wouldn’t like to guess when!

Bitcoin’s value offering as a technology is now widely known and fairly established. It’s room for growth as a platform is somewhat dependent upon adoption by major players now - a country using it as its primary currency or a few major banks adopting it will offer a chance for it to keep going. But in terms of innovation there isn’t going to be anything new to see from Bitcoin itself. Inversely, its huge price might be a bubble that’s set to burst at some point and even if not it’s vulnerable to big swings from all manner of influences. Criticism over its poor green credentials may have an unknown impact yet too.

Comparatively, Ethereum has a far wider value offering because it offers more than just the currency (Ether) using its blockchain. There’s a huge amount to be released in coming months and years that I think will make it the centre of innovation in the field and the focus of attention, while BTC has little to compare beyond novelty. As ETH moves to PoS it will also improve its green credentials and become the environmentally-conscious person’s choice - probably a major factor for businesses in the coming years when choosing who to work with on new projects. 

Ultimately, BTC has nothing to offer but an inflated coin that is first and famous. ETH has a whole platform to offer and will become increasingly resilient the more projects rely on it.",2021-05-14

"I have been doing that, I was down a considerable amount for awhile but kept building my position and am glad I did. I’m thinking long term. I’m also thinking we are early on this lifecycle graph and maybe around the pivotal point highlighted in the following link as ETH and crypto is being embraced by govt, institutions, and the masses at this very moment:

1. Early Adopter Chasm: https://medium.com/@shivayogiks/what-is-technology-adoption-life-cycle-and-chasm-e07084e7991f 

2. Original Theory is [Diffusion of Innovations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)",2021-04-16
"1) No. Ethereum is absolutely separate from the ERC20 economy, but I will say they tend to be linked in the short term. Generally speaking, almost every ERC20 token I can think of from five years ago when ERC20 was just kicking off is worth roughly zero (with a few exceptions, namely MKR).

1) (the second). This isn't the first time the block reward has been cut. It used to be 5Eth per block. Ethereum has whats called a ""network effect"" at this point, and that has nothing to do with the actual network. What that means is since so many projects are already on Ethereum, a new project is more likely to launch on Ethereum than any other comparable network. If something disastrous happens in the switchover to Eth2.0, I would expect most people would just stay on the Eth1.0 network.

2) BNB is a token, but what most people talk about in relation to BNB is the Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, which BNB interfaces with. the BSC is effectively a comparable version of the Ethereum network, and personally I use it as a ""high stakes testnet"" since I don't think malicious actors really do much on the testnets, but the memepool games and whatnot absolutely are happening on the BSC.

2a) I think ETH2.0 scaling will work. Once I didn't but the Eth2.0 testnets are exceptionally impressive.",2021-04-15

"First and foremost. ETH is NOT a store of value.

"But with proof of stake, all the computing power comes from ETH holders. If ETH is worth 0 then nobody will be incentivized to stake and this would still have detrimental effects on dapps no?",2021-04-15
What are your thoughts on the idea that any block chain will get higher transaction fees/sustainability issues as the network increases?,2021-04-16
"Even if eth is worth 0.00001 people will still be incentivized to stake. 

Actually a layer 2 solution MATIC/Polygon does this already for Ethereum and the APY is ~20.00%. The cost of the token is 0.43 and the gas fees are almost zero.

Imagine swapping tokens on uniswap almost for free.",2021-04-15
I’m not sure what you’re asking? With any network as it grows massively over night there will be sustainability issues and a token that shoots up. However a good system should self regulate and not bone the users for transaction fee gouging. The stability tends to sort itself out over time as more people join or if you’re in a newer system where you can introduce yourself through protocol or community vote.,2021-04-16

"ADA is not ""decentralised like ETH"".

It uses DPOS, which isn't really truly decentralised, and it has only around 1000 total validators. This number is unlikely to grow significantly due to the high barrier to entry, and that most people will need to delegate their stakes to these **centralised** staking pools.

ETH 2.0 has over 100,000 individual validators already, and growing everyday. It allows users to run their own validator, rather than having to delegate their stake to a third party pool operator.

Not to mention, that many of the ADA validators are actually still centralised. There is a plan to switch off all the centralised ADA nodes later this year. However the developers are able to switch them back on at anytime, and can in theory take 100% control of the blockchain whenever they want. Again, there is a future plan to hard fork and remove this control, but it is unclear when that will actually happen.

Cardano, in it's current form, is extremely centralised, just like BSC. While they do have a roadmap, it is less ambitious, and less progressed than the ETH 2.0 roadmap.

Here is a run down:

**ETH 1.0**

* Fully decentralised, proof of **work** (POW) blockchain
* Working smart contract platform, with proven 100% uptime

**ETH 2.0**

* Fully decentralised, proof of **stake** (POS) blockchain, without the need for centralised staking pools
* Smart contract platform still in development

**Cardano**

* Partially centralised, partially **delegated** proof of **stake** (DPOS) blockchain. However a move to a fully DPOS blockchain is in progress. DPOS, once fully achieved later this year, still requires centralised staking pools.
* Smart contract platform still in development",2021-02-28
"\>(and soon ADA)

I wouldn't expect a 4 years old smart contract platform that still has no smart contract to deliver anything on the date they claim they will.

Also BSC is literally not a crypto. It's just a regular centralized website you can run solidity code on.",2021-02-28

"I'll apply to help out:

* I run /r/EthDev ( we've linked to /r/eth in our sidebar since forever, feel free to link back ).

* Got a good historical understanding of how crypto-communities in the past have derailed due to having the wrong people gathering too much power and the effects it had on projects ( having witnessed the /r/Bitcoin fork, as well as Ethereums TheDAO fork - from a front seat and how the subreddits played a great part of how the stories unfolded for better, or for worse ).

* I'd be happy to offer advice on how to prevent these hostile takeovers from happening, and how to uphold democratic values in subreddits which are heavily top-down oriented by nature. I believe the integrity of the communities to be especially important for decentralized society-changing technologies like Ethereum, and for this reason I'm known to be more strict toward moderators than toward users. 

* My philosophy has always been: preventing abuse by moderators and keeping communities the property of the public, as much as feasibly possible. Practically, you can (easily) maintain integrity by creating a climate where moderators have to respect the users more than the other way around.  I believe this to be key. The users are your guests, and the moderators should **help** them (not *rule* them). I can offer you advice on how to build and maintain such a healthy balance.


* Some key differences between the Ethereum-related subs that I am familiar with:

 At /r/EthDev we are open to recruiting new moderators all year round, and we have perhaps the biggest number of moderators in any crypto sub ( a total of 31 , for 35k users ) to ensure openness.

 /r/EthTrader wishes to keep the team small ( 6 people, for 1 million users ). That's another way of running a sub which I personally find risky in the sense you need to have more luck in having the ""right select few"". This *can* work with the right people onboard. But this can also fail with the wrong people. If you opt for such a strategy, /u/carlslarson might be happy to help you out for the selection process and giving you tips, he's a great person.

 /r/Ethereum is run mainly by a highly-thrustworthy team of people who've done a lot for the Ethereum technology ( 13 people, for 700k users) . Having one of them to join your moderation team always seems like a valuable choice imho.

* I can help on some technical stuff ( setting up automated spam filtering, similar to what we use )

* You can always contact me for help or advice, regardless of which vision you decide to apply for this subreddit.

I hope these extra bits can help you get an idea of how you could form the /r/eth subreddit.",2021-02-27

Last time when CMEs were introduced to bitcoin the price was around 14k and ran to 20k in a few day then down it went. I see a solid break up for 4 to 5 days but I would lean on the side of caution especially if the extension is hit around 1800 up to 2000. I could see a pull back to 1110, and then with coinbase ipo coming out in end of February first of March I could see another drive up.

Why?,2020-05-14
"Ok here's an example.

I hold MCO and the current price is $5 per MCO

I want to buy bitcoin because I believe the price will reach $10000 and the current price is $8000, but I also believe that the price of MCO will go up.

With the loan requiring 75% loan to value.

I deposit 2,134 MCO wich equals roughly $10,666 and I receive 1 bitcoin.

The MCO is still mines so any increase I still capitalize on any increase.

The loan is at 7% annual so that's equal to $46.67 for a 30 day loan. And then there is a loan match fee equal to 1% of the loan amount, in this case it will be  $80 because the loan was for 1 bitcoin at $8000.

That leaves total cost at $126.67

Bitcoin rises to $10,000 
Profit = 10,000-( borrowed amount 8000+ total cost 126.67)= $1873.33 

PLUS 
During loan MCO rises to $5.50 × 2134 = Total value is now  $11,737 vs $10,666 when opened the loan.

Result in total account gain of $1873.33 from bitcoin + equity increase of $1071 from MCO price increase
= $2944.33",2020-05-14

When you Borrow ETH, you only need to deposit prepaid interest. The Lender must deposit the ETH that they are lending equity for.

"Its actually a Contract-for-Difference (CFD) as opposed to an ETH loan or borrow, in that no ETH is transferred from the lender to the borrower. CFDs have financing rates, like the swaps in BitMEX.

"The description on the website compares it to a '**Call Option**', which it is most similar to.

I thought ""Ether Loans"" was more catchy than  ""Ether Contract-for-Difference"".",2019-05-22
"OK, this is more complicated than I thought. The ETH Loan amount is adjusted--in ETH--if the ETH price rises, but not if it falls.  The interest rate is like an option premium, though unlike an option premium it is charged via a unit of time.  Given an option's 'time value' is maximized when the strike equals the current price, after the first movement the borrower will want to exit, because if the initial interest rate was acceptible, after the contract loses some of its optionality the interest rate--and thus implied option premium--will be too high. This is true whether the borrower is in or out of the money. There's a reason why such option contracts don't exist.",2019-05-22
"The borrower should not exit after the first movement for the same reason that an ETH holder should not exit after the first movement.

You can take either side of the deal (borrower or lender) at any interest rate that you choose, so if you feel one side of the deal is bad, then take the other side. 

Just for fun, I will probably accept any offer that you post.",2019-05-22
"If the interest rate is zero the borrower has a free option: he makes ETH if prices rise, pays no ETH if prices fall. Clearly that is not going to sustain a market, because the lender would be expecting to lose money, and rational people do not do that. Not only must it be non-zero, but it must capture the implied volatility of the ETH price.

As this option premium is paid out as an interest rate, it costs the same on day 1 as day 30. On day 1, the option is at-the-money and the time value of the option is at its maximum. After a short while, the ETH price will move and the option value will fall as ETH deviates from its initial price. Thus, if an option is priced just right, so that an interest expense covers the implied volatility (say, a 0.14% daily interest rate, or around 50% ann), the next day it will be too high because the option value will have decreased as the price (probably) moved.

If the option value is ""too high"" on day 1, it will always be too high, and there will be no buyers (borrowers in this market). If the option value is ""too low"" on day 1, there will be no sellers because they will statistically lose money, as selling an underpriced option will generate losses.",2019-05-22
