NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. 

TA is good at interpreting the past, but if it was able to actually predict the future then somebody already wrote a script that can suck the value out of that play faster than any of our monkey brains can.

This is true regarding ETH, BTC, the price of gold, the S&P, bond yields, you name it. Trading is not much different than gambling in the short term

Two Warren Buffet quotes (I think):

""The market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent.""

In other words the market doesn't give a shit how smart you think you are, you either need the ability to wait or you should not be in it.

""The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term.""

In other words, what we just saw over the past 2 months was the voting machine. Now the weighing machine is kicking in. Perhaps we were a little overbought, fine. If you have time to wait then you'll see another cycle happen. If not, then you shouldn't be in it.

Good luck, young bucks. Keep reading these subs for fun, but remember:

Ethereum & the Hodlors that love them,1498628810.0,"Because I know most people in here aren't seeing the big picture with Ethereum on a protocol level let's go over a few (very) important things coming in the near future.

Metropolis (Ethereum 3.0) - This upgrade is slated for Aug/Sept and will be the first upgrade since Homestead (Ethereum 2.0) from early last year and for reference Frontier (Ethereum 1.0). Metropolis will bring with it some huge upgrades. 

Raiden - Currently Ethereum can process a max of 15 transactions per second, Bitcoin can do about 7. This is nowhere near what Visa does at 40k/tx per second. You've heard of Bitcoins lightening network which will enable Bitcoin to do infinite tx/sec? Well Raiden enables the exact same thing on Ethereum by creating what are called ""Payment Channels"". Not gonna go into too much detail but it's like Bob and Carol agree to put a $100 deposit into an account and write notes saying one or the other owes $x amount, then on a predetermined day one of you squares up the account by making one large transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.

ZN-Snarks - You know how your friends tell you Ethereum isn't anonymous like Monero or ZCash? Well ZK-Snarks will enable you to selectively make transactions public or private. It's the same standard used for ZCash but implemented on the protocol level on top of Ethereum. This is a big part of Enterprise Ethereum Alliances road map which is why JP Morgan is working with ZCash to implement it into Quorum (JP Morgan private Ethereum Chain) as well. Ethereum is basically taking all the best features from other coins and implementing them.

Ice Age - Currently, there are ~93 Million ETH circulating with 5 ETH created every 15 seconds (15% annual inflation) during the last upgrade (Frontier) there was an ""Ice Age"" coded into Ethereum which would slow down the creation of ETH on a curve that would eventually freeze up Ethereum. The reason for this was to force the developers to finish up Metropolis before the network froze up. One side effect of the ice age is that the creation of ETH slows down thus reducing the rate of inflation but also increasing the transaction time. We're beginning to see the first effects of it and by August it'll be 5 ETH created every ~30 seconds.

Casper - Shortly after Metropolis, Ethereum will release the actual figures for Casper as well as the first of 5 phases which will move Ethereum from PoW (Proof of Work) using mining rigs and computers to approve transactions to PoS (Proof of Stake). What happens with PoS is instead of miners running all the time, you will have people holding ETH ""Stake"" their ETH and basically lock their ETH up in a smart contract while running software on their internet connected computer. In return for locking their ETH up, they will earn interest on it at an undermined rate (figures Vitalik has floated around varies from 6-12% annually). Not everyone will be able to stake, Vitalik has stated that the inflation rate of ETH will drop from 15% currently down to 0-2%. With basic supply and demand math you should be able to figure out what that means for the price.

Casper is a major reason people are stocking up on ETH. Imagine if in 1 year you could lock up 1000 ETH and earn 120 ETH per year? If the price is $1000/ETH you're talking USD $120k annual without selling any of your original ETH.

Edit: some typos, was writing on the treadmill."
WARNING: Poloniex is withholding my funds from me,1498149006.0,"TLDR: Left some ETH in poloniex when they suspended service in my state. When they didnt un-suspend service when laws changed, I asked for my coins back. They balked at helping me. Its been 1 month, not sure if they ever plan on answering and I'm out 270 ETH (+ other alts).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT:  As another user as suggested, I'd really appreciate the upvotes for visibility. I hope that this benefits the greater crypto community by educating on the dangers of keeping your funds in an exchange. I also hope this serves as a huge red flag for poloniex users and prospective users. This is how much they care about you (not even enough to have a real person answer your multiple tickets and emails).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOUBLE EDIT: Last night I received a message from poloniex that my ETH withdraw has been initated! Finally got my eth back, thanks to everyone who upvoted, I know that this thread is the only reason I got my funds back. Unfortunately, the Monero and Bitcoin that I had in poloniex were not withdrawn (despite having specified the deposit addresses and balance with ‚Äúdecimal precision‚Äù). I‚Äôm hoping that these withdraws are also processed, but I‚Äôm just thankful that my ETH was returned. Although I was planning to, I have not contacted the SEC or any other regulatory body. From responses on this thread, I realize how many other people are in a similar boat. I hope that poloniex finds a way to increase its capacity to meet customer demand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I am writing this to make people aware of just how bad customer service has gotten on Poloniex. I have been a customer and user of poloniex since 2015. Most of my eth that I now own was traded for on their exchange. I live in New Hampshire, USA which means back in ~October 2016 my account was ""temporarily suspended"" due to local laws (which have long since been overruled).

Poloniex announced a couple weeks in advance that they were going to be shutting down service to NH, so I prepared by withdrawing as much of my funds as possible. I was able to get most off without a problem but there was still a handful (~270) of ETH that I was unable to withdraw before the window closed. At the time I wasnt worried. The note from poloniex stated:

>You will receive an email with instructions. In brief, you will have until October 6, 2016 (two weeks from the date of this notice) to close any open orders and withdraw your funds. If you aren't able to locate this email, please contact Support for assistance.
>Although your account will be suspended, your data will remain on file. If you attempt to log in, you will be restricted to areas only for viewing and exporting historical data.  When we resume operations in New Hampshire, you will be able to log back into your account with all of your historical data and any remaining balances intact.
>Our legal team is working closely with the State of New Hampshire Banking Department and other regulatory agencies to verify that changes in their statutes apply to the services offered by Poloniex and to seek licenses where necessary. This is a nascent industry; as the regulations around it mature, these types of service disruptions may not be entirely avoidable, but we have been and will continue to be proactive in educating regulators and monitoring both existing laws and upcoming changes to these laws so that we can limit interruptions wherever possible.


I assumed that as soon as the laws changed (which they did in January), poloniex would re-enable service to NH and I would be able to access and continue to trade my coins at that time.

Fast forward to May 23 (one month ago)...Despite the NH law changes, poloniex still had not re-enabled my account. The 270 eth that were worth ~$3,200 USD in October are now worth ~$89,100. I decided enough was enough, I needed to take my eth out of poloniex once and for all. As instructed, I contacted support by opening a ticket explaining my situation. I waited over a week and recieved no human response from poloniex. I submitted a new ticket 8 days after I submitted the first, this time I used a different label on the ticket. On submitting this ticket I recieved this automated email:

>Before closing your Poloniex account you have a chance to provide proof of residency outside of the suspended Country/Estate.
>If you would like to submit proof of residency outside of the suspended Country/Estate please reply to this message and ask for an agent to begin the process of updating your Poloniex profile, do not send any document via email or ticket, the support agent will guide you through uploading the necessary files to your Poloniex profile.
>If you really is a resident of the suspended Country/Estate or prefer to close the account, please login to your Poloniex account and reply to this message providing the exact amount you have on balance of each currency, with decimal precision, and an address for the final withdrawal to be processed for each.
>Please provide an address for each of the currencies, Poloniex may not trade in your behalf.


I provided all the information they needed that same day, waited another week, still no human response.

On June 6th, I submitted another ticket stating that I really needed to withdraw these funds and that I had still not recieved any human response despite fulfilling all automated requests.


I waited 5 more days before I finally got message from what appears to have been a human:

>I do sincerely apologize for the late reply, due to regulations we are unable to process the withdrawal of the whole balance at once unless you submit your full SSN number, i have cleared just cleared the SSN field on  your profile, please let me know If/when you upload it and i will send it to verification immediately
 >If you prefer not to complete the profile page, your account will be re opened in a limited manner so you can withdrawal the coins yourself at a rate of less than $2000 United States Dollar equivalent per day.
>Best regards, 
>Christopher Bologna
>Poloniex Support

That same day, I logged in, updated my SSN field and replied to the ticket letting them know I had done so. I recieved this response from the same agent:

>Thank you for entering your SSN, we can now proceed with your full withdrawal,Please log into your Poloniex account and let me know exactly how much you have on balance of each currency, with decimal precision, and address to send the coins to.

Despite having already provided this info in a previous ticket, I provided it all again. The email response I got (June 10):

>I will now forwarding you ticket to a agent that will assist in withdrawing your coins and i am afraid there is no time frame for re allowing NH customers,if you need quick access to the coins you wont be able to access them so it is strongly recommended that you send the coins to a wallet you control

And that was the last I heard from them on this ticket, no one has touched it.

Two days ago (June 20), I created yet another ticket letting them know that I had recieved no help on my previous tickets and that I really needed my funds from them. I also told them I planned on creating a new ticket each day that I did not recieve a response (which I have).

Anyhow I'm starting to get a little dejected. I am not sure I'll ever see my ETH again. I'm wondering if I should start seeking legal counsel? Would it be worth the money and effort just to extract 270 ETH that was mine in the first place? If anyone has any ideas I'm happy to hear them. I just want this to be yet another warning to you all, get your coins off exchanges, especially ones like poloniex who seem to get shadier each day."

https://join.slack.com/t/icoreview/shared_invite/MjEzNzQ4MjY0ODgwLTE1MDAzOTk2MjItMDk3Yjg4M2RkOQ)

I think it's time our community decided to take initiative and provide a community rating for ICOs. We do a lot of bitching but not a lot of action taking. If anyone is willing to help me with site building and become part of a collaboration of minds we could provide a place where traders can contribute their well rounded insight on upcoming projects. If we can become a reliable ""evaluator"" of projects over time we might be able to enforce standards on ICOs in order for them to be successful (working proof concepts, auditable ICO token smart contracts, designated allocation of funds, etc). I'm willing to put in the effort to bring this to reality if anyone else wants to help or at the very least think this would be useful. 

Edit: it should also be made clear this rating wouldn't be a rating based on potential profitability. We wouldn't want to become the ""amazon review rating"" of eth projects. It is merely a certification of whether or not the team has done their due diligence on each respective project. "

For my fellow Ethtraders, here a few lessons I've learned - usually the hard way - along the ride so far...

1) You, me, Jamie Dimon, Mike Novogratz, ScienceGuy9489 and even Vitalik have no fricking idea what's gonna happen. He's said so himself.

Ethereum could shoot up to 750 tomorrow and then fall to 75 the next day. Or it could lurk around 300 for the next two years before exploding to 3000. Who knows! If you have conviction in the technology invest what you are willing to lose and don't get hung up on the day to day movement. It's just noise. 

2) This has been said a million times, but for good reason: Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. For most people, this means no more than 10-20% of your money. This really goes for any asset class, even cash since there's inflation risk - but especially crypto. Ideally, in addition to crypto your money is diversified among a variety of asset classes like fiat, stocks, bonds, gold, etc. 

3) Never, ever buy or sell on emotion. As a rule, if you feel like you *have* to buy or sell right away, then you don't. Sure, you might luck out once or twice doing so, but this is called gambling, not trading. Being impulsive will ultimately screw you over. 

Our brains are running on millennia old legacy software designed to run away from threats e.g., panic sell, to follow the herd e.g., fomo buy, and in general to survive, *not* to be rational. When big dollar signs are flashing around, our lizard brains think it's life or death and all reason goes out the window. This is why the vast majority of traders, even professionals, lose money. 

Of course in a bull market everyone is a genius. So it's easy to kid yourself, but you're probably not a great trader. I know I'm not. I've read books on trading, and I'm not a total idiot, but the fact is I would be sitting on a lot more Ether right now if I had just bought and held rather than getting all fancy. 

There are a few folks who have zen-like discipline or years of experience, but for the rest of us, short-term trading is a losing game. That said, you can treat a small portion of your holdings as play money that you daytrade. Just don't be surprised if it's gone next week. 

4) Don't be a maximalist. God knows I was when I first arrived here. I thought Bitcoin was Myspace and Ethereum was Facebook. I came to realize Bitcoin and Ethereum are not competitors; they are trying to do different things. The world needs both gold and oil.

5) This may sound blasphemous, but don't be absolutist about HODL-ing. For most, I think it's wise to take some profits as it goes up by selling a small to moderate portion of your holdings. Then, if/when it majorly corrects you won't freak out and panic sell. Instead, you can buy some back at a lower price. And if it doesn't correct, you'll still walk away with some profit and peace of mind. 

Now, if you are very patient and don't need to take profits it's fine to 100% HODL if you are truly able to stick with it. Just be honest with yourself. There are a lot of fair-weather 'hodlers' here who hit the sell button whenever there's a major pullback. It's better, not to mention a hell of a lot easier to sell when it's pumping up than when it's plummeting. 

6) It's human nature to never be satisfied. No matter how low you bought, you'll wish you had bought lower or bought more. Or you're gonna kick yourself for not selling at a peak. Remember, most people in this world still have no idea what Ethereum is and even if they do, they do not see its potential like you and me. We're early to the party.

7) Keep your life in balance. This is more important than all the above combined. Sure, it's fine to go through a phase where this consumes your life, but if you spend all day and night staring at red and green on GDAX your health and happiness will suffer. Trust me, I've been there. 

Trading is already addictive but throw in a 24/7 market that never sleeps with bewildering volatility and you have the perfect recipe for sleep deprivation, anxiety, and manic ups and downs.

If you're overly obsessed with checking prices, try either setting ground rules (what I do is that I only check prices between 10am and 10pm) or step away completely for a few days or a week. I've done this a few times and I always return to the markets with renewed energy and perspective. 

Money is important but once you have enough to get by, it's far less so than friends, family, health, and finding meaningful things to do in life. Remember guys, love over lambos, balance over Binance, and bros over blockfolios.. okay that last one was a stretch..

Finally, it's been said before, but that's because it's the truth: the joy is in the journey. Everything in this world is temporary. Whether Ethereum faces some existential threat and gets wiped out tomorrow or goes on to revolutionize human civilization for centuries to come, someday something else will come along and replace it. 

Likewise, your stash may someday be worth zero or a million. But either way you will have won the bigger game in town if you enjoyed the ride and learned a few things along the way. 

Stay safe, stay hungry, and enjoy the ride! 

*Note: Thank you guys for all the replies and encouragement, it means a lot. I had no idea this post would blow up like this. In hindsight, I wish I had titled this post something different and put less emphasis on the quitting job part because that's not what this post is really about. I realized from the responses that the post gives the impression that I am retiring for the rest of my life and intend to never work again. This is definitely not the case! Ethereum simply expedited me getting out of a job situation that I wanted out on anyway and has afforded me some more flexibility and freedom in the short to medium term. While I'm taking a bit of the break from the grind right now, I'll be pursuing work a bit down the line both for financial reasons and because it's part of a meaningful life*"

I sold a nice chunk of my ICO ETH yesterday at $330 and now that the transfer is complete I'm sending it on to the mortgage company!

I know that ETH has a long way to grow still. I know that the measly ROI I'll get by not having my mortgage doesn't make mathematical sense. I know that I could probably do better than my interest rate investing in plain old mutual funds. I know that I still have to pay insurance and property tax. I know that I will no longer have the interest deduction on my taxes. I know that ETH will probably shoot to the moon just as soon as the ACH to the mortgage company clears.

**BUT** what I can't put a price on is the feeling of walking barefoot through my yard and knowing that every blade of grass, every ant hill and mole mound, every dead mouse in the walls, every shingle on the roof, and every single splinter of wood on the property are mine.

It was very hard to let go of my precious ETH but you know what? The security and stability that this brings to my life is worth every penny of my $159 cost basis. Tonight when I get home from work I will turn my key in the lock of a 100% paid-off property. I think that it's fitting that I was able to do this during the ""Homestead"" release.

**EDIT**: 

Wow, this blew up. More updoots than the daily?! I'm totally blown away by the reaction to this post. Thank you all for your kindness and encouragement - I honestly didn't expect it in quite the quantity that you're sending my way. My parents raised me well and I'm trying hard to respond to each of you and thank you for your kindness but I might miss some. If I do, I apologize.

Some common questions have come up:

**""How'd you get USD out?""** I used about a dozen transactions staggered over several days from my Ledger Nano S -> GDAX / Gemini -> Bank Account -> Mortgage company. It was all done via ACH and wires.

**""Taxes?""** I kept track of each sale to USD, calculated my cost basis, and reserved back an additional ~20% on top of my payoff amount. I pay quarterly federal taxes and will send them a giant whack of cash (on a credit card so I get the Chase points!) in September. It's best to pay the capital gains in the same quarter in which you realized them.

**""So that's it? You're out?""** No. I still have some ETH left that I'm hodling at least until POS. I believe in the technology.

**""Lambo?""** No. Our neighborhood has speed bumps... Maybe an Aston when we moon. ;)

**""Property taxes etc.""** Yep. Cost of living in the USA... I like my roads, fire trucks, clean water, city parks, trash service, recycling service, and walking trails. :)"

For those who don't understand and/or lack the imagination, pretend for a moment that the [ERC 721 tokens](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721) which represent all the individual kitties on the blockchain didn't represent cats at all.  Imagine, instead, that they represented:

* loot items in World of Warcraft
* rare cards in online collectible card games
* plots of land in Arizona
* corporate stocks from Fortune 100 companies that trade on NASDAQ or the NYSE

Does that make more sense to you now?  People aren't necessarily excited about the actual cats themselves, they're excited by *the endless possibilties* that this demonstrates.

Go look at the online marketplace they've created.  Look at the user interface.  Fire up your imagination and envision a world where 'digital drawings of cats' are just one of the many, many, MANY assets being traded in the Ethereum eco-system.

THIS is precisely what gives Ether its value: the ability to create, tokenize, and trade things **on the blockchain.**  And this is the reason that CryptoKitties was deployed to the Ethereum blockchain and NOWHERE ELSE -- not Bitcoin, not Dash, not ETC (lol ETC). If you're mad about CryptoKitties, you're missing the whole point -- this isn't a distraction from the price, this is *exactly the reason that ETH rose 5000% over the past year.*

Yes, it's silly and it's goofy, but it's a proof of concept.  It demonstrates to the world what is currently possible, RIGHT NOW, in the Ethereum eco-system.  ETHEREUM, and nowhere else.  It's not about the cats, it's about the future potential of the whole protocol."

The story behind Ethereum Classic (ETC) - and who's trying to steal your wealth through it,1495670574.0,"I see a lot of newbies entering the market, people who hear about Ethereum. If you are such a person, you might be a little bit confused about why there is the Ethereum coin (ETH) and the Ethereum Classic coin (ETC).

Here is the story of what exactly happened. This is not research, but a first-hand story. I was there when it all happened, in the middle of it. And active in **all** involved communities.

#It all started during the spring of 2016:

There was only one Ethereum coin you could buy (ETH). The Ethereum world computer was online for not even a year. Most investors invested in Ethereum because they saw this world computer as something that could change and transform the world. This is not new for you guys reading this now, you are starting to see the potential too. But these early investors were visionaries. They could already see it before it started to happen.

They saw the possibilities and were excited about what had been built. Excited about what was still going to be build. 

So here follows what the early adopters did next:

#Growing the eco-system

An important task at that moment in time, was to grow the eco-system. Companies and startups would be created and motivated to play around with the possibilities of this new technology.

Thus the early investors were going to work together to build the eco-system up.

More than a thousand well intended investors had allocated a major part of their hard-earned wealth into a program / contract running on Ethereum (*the contract was named TheDAO*) which was created with the goal to fund startups in the eco-system for at least the next 4 years. 

The idea and the intention to grow the eco-system with this money, was so grand that more than **11 million Ether** (12 % of all ETH in circulation) were allocated to this contract. With the sole plan being that these funds would then later be redistributed over **hundreds of different projects**, all trying and building different use-cases for Ethereum.

#Then summer came, and a software bug

Then, for all these investors, the unthinkable happened. Due to an obscure bug in this contract, hackers managed to hijack and steal all of these funds. 

11 million Ether, now worth **more than 2 billion USD** that was meant for the growth and success of Ethereum, could now no longer be used. It was a doomsday scenario for the Ethereum world computer and all dreams and enthusiasm turned into a nightmare for both investors as Ethereum enthusiasts.

#Bitcoin community celebrations
 
There was joy too, on the other side of the crypto community. The biggest Bitcoin forum /r/Bitcoin , which was then famous for censoring (deleting) every single news piece on Ethereum, made an exception and allowed the posting of the ""Great Ethereum hack"". 

The supposedly pro-innovation Bitcoin-community celebrated the failure of another crypto-experiment that was trying to do something new. As if this was a competition instead of a collective project on building good things for the world. 

But their celebrations were premature.

#The Ethereum community stuck together,  worked together, and fought back. Successfully


Through a hard fork, the Ethereum Foundation together with the communities consensus executed a successful redistribution of these **funds** away from the rogue hackers **back into the hands** of those who **rightfully owned** these ethers before: **the investors**. This hard fork caused a split in the Ethereum chain, with the old chain and the new chain. 

The problem, the bug, the mistake, was undone. The money was once again in the hands of the investors, so it could feed the eco-system: a **VITAL** moment in Ethereum's history. 

And so it happened. All of the innovation that we've seen in the past year, and also the ICO's, got fueled by this money, money that was always meant for investments, growth. 

At the same time, not having 12 % of the coins in hands of 1 group of hackers, but instead distributed in the hands of the rightful owners, was another important element to ensure the Ethereum blockchain remains secure for the future (once we go to PoS, which I won't be explaining here now).

Ethereum has now reached **$200** on this day, **thanks to the efforts** of the entire Ethereum community, both investors as developers.


#/r/Bitcoin's reaction: The creation of ""Ethereum Classic"" (ETC)

But the Bitcoin community didn't approve of this success. Famous Bitcoin members like the /r/Bitcoin moderators, and institutional Bitcoin investors like Barry Silbert, who had been tweeting and posting about ""Why Ethereum can never work"" in the months before the above chaos, initiated a new plan.

The plan was to disrupt the Ethereum network by reviving the old chain. To prove that **""hard forks are dangerous"" by trying to make Ethereums' hard fork fail**, trying to kill off Ethereum in the process. This was going to be their best and probably only chance to get rid of this young but strong innovative ""rival"". Thus, they suddenly allowed Ethereum posts promoting **the mining of the old chain**. They also spawned their own community around it, calling it ""Ethereum Classic"" and **Barry Silberts** co-owned exchange ""Poloniex"" raced to be the first exchange to start trading the coin of this old chain (ETC). Thus artificially legitimatizing the ETC coin. 

These old Ethereum-haters turned into Ethereum Classic evangelists. The Ethereum Classic community was being joined solely by people who had a posting history of negativity against Ethereum. *None of these people had any /r/Ethereum posting history, while having a lot of /r/Bitcoin activity.*

How convenient for Bitcoin.

#ETC is an Attack against Ethereum

Let's make this clear here. Ethereum Classic is, and always has been, an attack **against** Ethereum, trying to disturb the cohesion of the Ethereum network and the Ethereum community. But let it be clear that the growth of Ethereums eco-system has proven that our community is much stronger and more vigilant than these attackers had hoped or imagined. The flippening, the moment ETH exceeds BTC, is coming closer every week.

Every time you buy ETC, you are actively supporting an attack on Ethereum by donating your money to these people, with the added risk to lose your investment. Ethereum Classic has no community, no development team, no future in the real world.

**It's a technological attack, and a monetary scam**, with its biggest investors and its biggest pumpers being people involved in Bitcoin, people like Barry Silbert.


If you believe in the future of Ethereum, buy the real deal, the real thing, which is the ether, the ETH that is the only token that gives you access to the real network.  

If you want to diversify your wealth, I encourage you to do so. Look for the real interesting innovative technologies that want to bring something good to this world, to let us all move forward. Even Bitcoin has its place and role.

If you have bought, or holding, or still planning to buy ETC, be ready to get hit by some nasty surprises down the road ( on those days - *and I can already foresee a few* - I will be linking everyone back to this thread right here, as a reminder). 

You can not build a future on a coin that's being sustained by rotten apples, scammers, with mal-intent and the lack of an intelligent development community. People are going to burn their hands, and lose their money.


These scammers are losers. 

It's at our side, here in the ETH community, that innovation is to be found. The side of the inventor of Ethereum - Vitalik Buterin himself - and our collective team of thousands of developers who have created the greatness in Ethereum. Invest in them, support them. 

Be a part of history, not against it.

Personal Finance Rules for Being an Effective Holder,1513886172.0,"***Personal Finance Rules for Being an Effective ETH (or any Cryptocurrency) Holder***

Before I was an ethtrader (*read ethholder*), I was (and still am) a Boglehead.  If you don't know what [Bogleheads are](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T030-C009-S002-investing-lessons-from-vanguard-s-bogleheads.html), we are personal finance nerds who live relatively frugally and work to achieve solid investment returns, while minimizing costs and managing risks.  We are named after Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard who pioneered low cost index funds.

In my time as investor, I can count on *no hands* the number of people I know who ""got rich quick"" (and actually held on to the money), because it is zero.  Becoming rich isn't just about making the right investment calls, it's about having the right mindset and secure financial position to build wealth over time.

**Based upon how emotionally some react here to relatively minor price movements (or no movement), I get the sense that some people have dramatically overextended themselves to buy crypto.**  This is bad for the individual, but also bad for all of crypto.  It will exacerbate wild price swings and could tarnish crypto's image if there is a crash.  I can't stop everyone from doing stupid things, but I can give you guys my advice.  Take it or leave it.

People who are overextended tend to make very stupid financial decisions when put under emotional duress, *and they often significantly underperform the market.*  This is not just an issue of personality- this is *an issue of personal financial security and stability.*  If you are insecure in your financial position, you are more likely to do something really stupid at exactly the wrong time.  We've all been in that position before, but the question is how do you remove yourself from it?

**Here are some questions to ask yourself.  If you answer yes to any of these, then I would say you are very likely overextended in your crypto position:**

- Do you NOT have a solid cash position in a savings account, to pay for at least 3 to 6 months expenses?
- Do you NOT hold any other investment assets besides crypto (like lower risk stocks and bonds)?
- Are you NOT saving for retirement outside of crypto?  If crypto went to zero, would you be forced to retire at a later age than you have planned for now?
- Have you borrowed any money to buy crypto, even from low interest sources like home equity (*really terrible* idea, by the way)?  Do you have any debt beyond your mortgage and student loans, either revolving (such as credit cards) or on depreciating assets (like big car loans)?
- If all of your crypto went to zero, would your lifestyle be negatively affected?  Could you still pay your bills?  Would you be put in a position where you would need borrow money or sell other assets to make ends meet?
- Are you concentrated in too few coins and does that make you nervous? (Note: At this moment, I am nearly 100% ETH, but it doesn't make me nervous.  Because I answered ""no"" to all of the questions above, I can afford this risk.)
- Have you FOMO'ed in the recent past between coins?  Do you think you'd be susceptible to doing it again?

**If you answered ""No"" to all of those questions, then it really doesn't matter how much of your net worth is comprised of crypto.**  Crypto has become a fairly substantial percentage of my net worth, but it's all gravy, and I can literally afford to lose it all.  I wouldn't be happy, but I wouldn't be ruined.  From a net worth perspective, I sort of pretend it does not exist.  This gives me the stability to make smart, rational decisions, instead of emotional ones.

**If crypto is a substantial percentage of your net worth, AND you answered ""yes"" to any of the questions above, then you could be in a risky, insecure position, where you are more likely to make really stupid decisions around your crypto investments and everything else related to your personal finances.**  *If I were in that position, I would consider selling enough of my crypto so I could answer ""no"" to all of those questions.*  It might not matter today, and it might not matter tomorrow, but one day it could (be it due to an unexpected rise or crash that you are not ready for).

This mindset has also allowed me to participate in an amazing run-up in ETH, without feeling like I ""have to sell.""  I can let this ride for a long while and let this mega bull market work for me, instead of me working for it.

**In matters of personal finance, I always believe that it is prudent to be prepared for a worst case scenario.  Manage your risk and your exposure, and you will be in a better position to make smart investment decisions.**  If you do this right, you might not be rich tomorrow, but you very well could be in 5 to 10 years.  And you will probably sleep better at night."

Someone Just Stoke Over 150k In Crypto From Me. Here's How They Did It. Now Let's Catch Them,1526743171.0,"Alright guys, I've had a sleepless night but now I'm ready to get to work on tracking down the asshats who took my money.

First, let me tell you that I consider myself to be safe with my money. I have two factor authorization set up on every account. I also have triggers to disable accounts if new IPs are used to log in. I also avoid phishing emails, always check the addresses emails come from, and don't click on attachments. But guess what, that wasn't enough.

Here's what they did.

1. They somehow spoofed my phone number and had it go to a different SIM card. My current sim card stopped working all of a sudden.
2. I spoke with my cell carrier and they said that there were no manual changes to my sim card with them, so I'm still not sure how this step was completed.
3. They logged into all of my emails \(they had all of my accounts queued up and ready to go\). Once they took over my phone they then put all of my email accounts into recovery mode and had them send codes to my phone for recovery.
4. They then quickly changed all of my email passwords.
5. Next, they logged into every exchange I use and did resets of the passwords or just logged in if they had the password using the 2FA since they now had my phone and emails.
6. They then proceeded to drain my main exchange account on Gemini. Luckily they couldn't get into Binance \(well done Binance\). Gemini did initially freeze my account when they discovered a new IP, but then they sent a freaking email with a link to immediately unfreeze it. No waiting period, nothing. So, it was a useless security step since they had access to my email. They then made two big transfers of my BTC and ETH out of my account.
7. Here is the ETH address they sent to: 0x25c6f8e1ffa1656e6d4546932Dc68b6889A8D769
8. Here is the BTC address they sent to: 1CuhKC6f6YUqJnuDPT28vqiktVR7chE7nG
9. Since they logged into my email, I got the two IP addresses they were using to do all of this.
10. First IP address: 217.151.98.69 based out of London, UK
11. Second IP address: 68.235.48.108 based out of Chicago, US

Now, by the time I made it to the cell phone store to get a new Sim Card \(I had a feeling something like this was happening\) everything had already been done. I couldn't stop it because I was immediately cut off from communication and it all went down in about 15 minutes. This was obviously a coordinated attack.

So, let's see what we can do as a community to keep these scum bags from messing with anyone else.

1. If those scum bags see this post, you can return the money and everything will be forgotten and I won't pursue this anymore.
2. If they don't return the money, I'll be going to the FBI, Interpol, and whoever else I need to with the information I have. We'll all be watching this money going forward, and no matter how many times they move it, we'll find out where it ends up and make it hell for them to try and spend it. If it makes it into an exchange, law enforcement can then subpoena the exchange for the information to make an arrest. Basically I'll do everything in my power to ensure that if these asshats try and use my money, the authorities will find out.
3. In 24 hours, if the funds haven't been returned, I'll be placing a MASSIVE bounty on the identification of these douchebags. And then every white knight, grey hat, and black hat individual out there will have a vested interest in bringing these guys to justice.

Basically, I'm giving them 24 hours to make this right. If they don't, I'll do everything in my power to make sure they worry about every spending any of that money with the threat of a lengthy jail sentence hanging over their head.

EDIT: Also, if folks could share this on the other crypto subs to give it as much visibility as possible. I don't have the karma to post on some of them.  THANKS!"

"To all the people hating on MyEtherWallet: It's not their fault, it's YOURS. You don't understand how it works, so please stop.",1497975621.0,"Ethereum is a decentralized network. The ""right way"" to perform transactions in the network is for you to connect to the network **directly** and to submit your own transactions **directly**. This would require you to run a wallet or node that connects directly to the network. This would take longer for you to set up and you'd have to download (at least part of) the blockchain, maintain it, maintain peers, etc etc.

MyEtherWallet, a 100% free and 100% open source project. They are nice enough to do all this work *for your convenience*. They run their own nodes, synchronize the blockchain, and push *your transactions* to the blockchain *for you* free of charge, and that's on top of them providing all the beautiful wallet generation tools for free too.

So instead of moaning on about how awful MEW is because your ICO purchase didn't go through... first realize that

1) you're complaining about a free service that thousands of people are trying to use at once. Unless you're going to donate 100 ETH to them to cover their server costs then your complaints are impractical.

2) You're complaining about something without understanding how it works, and you don't even realize you're also doing it wrong to begin with. If you want a 100% reliable wallet 24/7 then you have to go set one up and maintain it yourself. So quit complaining about the people nice enough to let you use *their node* at *their expense* for free because you are too lazy to set up a proper wallet/node yourself.

3) the status.im contribution page listed *five different ways* you can contribute. *Three* of these ways connect directly to the network and they even provided *video tutorials* on how to use them. These would've solved your problems today. You quite literally tried spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on something without reading the instructions, and then when things went wrong you decided to blame the good guys at MEW, who are the only party in this equation not making money from the ICO, by the way."

Here is the whitepaper.

https://dn-peiwo-web.qbox.me/Tron-Whitepaper-1031-V18-EN.pdf

On bottom half of page 2

Realization Path of TRON

 1. Exodus, Data Liberation

 2. Odyssey, Content Empowerment

 3. Apollo, Free Movement of Value Decentralized Token Trading Exclusively for Individuals

 4. Star Trek, Traffic Monetizing Gaming of Decentralization and Market Forecast

 5. Eternity, Traffic Conversion De-centralized Game

I shit you not, this is what the paper actually says.

Here is the distribution on section 10.2

Total amount of TRX is 100 billion and will be allocated as follows:

Public offering: 40%

TRON Foundation and the ecosystem: 35%

Private offering: 15%

Pay initial supporter - Peiwo Huanle (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd.: 10%

CEO of Tron was the founder of Peiwo. 

Whoever is still buying Tron at this stage, good luck to you.

*PS: To all you people saying I am spreading FUD, just reading the god damn whitepaper and decide for yourself. I will link it 3 times so you your fat finger can't miss even if you tried.

It's apparent that lot of ETH investors don't understand what they own, and are just acting based on speculation of market cycles. By the end of this post I hope to help a few of you know a little more about what you own (or what you are thinking about owning) and why the current bull market is just a cherry on top of something much larger.

Here are a truckload of hugely positive things that *have not yet altered* the price of ETH*:*

* [EIP 1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq), **THIS UPCOMING SUMMER:**
   * Slashes mining profits and therefore cuts new ETH entering the economy. Miners are the most consistent sellers of ETH. Less new ETH entering the market means less ETH available to buy. This means the cost of ETH goes up significantly relative to current prices.
   * Fee burning - destroying a portion of the ETH used in transaction fees. ETH actively leaving the market means even less ETH available to buy. ETH goes up even more.
   * Both of these effects will take months to ripple through the exchanges, but their effects will be huge. Look at the regular [Bitcoin Halving](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769) event for reference, and be patient. Supply/demand shifts take months to hit prices.
* [The Merge](https://ethmerge.com/), **THIS UPCOMING WINTER**:
   * Mining ETH will be a thing of the past. Instead, all new ETH will be given to wallets that stake the ETH they already own. Basically, for putting the ETH you hold into a staking pool, you will be given more ETH at a rate of about 7% of what you own per year. That's a really generous interest rate, making ETH a competitive investment for the wealthy *even if the price of ETH stagnates.*
   * BUT - this will happen while ETH also continues to grow in value. Your existing ETH goes up, and owning ETH also gives you more ETH. In fact, this will be the *only way* new ETH is minted from then on. This is a *massive* incentive to sit on a pile of ETH, and only sell what you need to pay bills. Again, less selling means more expensive ETH.
   * This will also take months to ripple through exchanges as it's a supply/demand shift. Be patient.
* [Sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/) in **2022:**
   * This is a big one because a lot of seasoned crypto traders expect a bear market to start in 2022. I do too, but 2022 will be the year that Ethereum's adoption as technology takes off in a real way. With the implementation of sharding, and [eWASM](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/ethereum-2-0-a-complete-guide-ewasm-394cac756baf), Ethereum is going to change the world. That doesn't mean the bear market won't hit us, but it means one of two things: either the bear market's impact on ETH will be dramatically reduced, *or*, we're about to experience the buying opportunity of a lifetime before ETH goes wildly parabolic at the end of the bear market.
   * When ETH 2.0 is fully deployed, the network will have gone from processing just over a dozen transactions per second (as it does today), to about 100,000. A speed increase of 10,000x, and an equivalent gas fee reduction. I'll let you decide whether or not you think that will make more developers, governments, institutions, and even just regular people want to use the Ethereum network.
* Public opinion and knowledge:
   * [**The flippening**](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/flippening/) **is coming. It's not an if. It's a when.** It may literally even be this year. When this happens the average joe news media is going to erupt. Public opinion will shift. Ethereum will be a household name. In a few years, family will be *approaching you* to ask about staking ETH, instead of you just talking their ears off about how you've doubled your net worth in a single month.
   * **Look at that graph in the flippening link -** The flip was on its way to happening before the crypto crash. ETH 2.0 is coming. This is not a question of ""if"". I don't know how anyone can look at that graph in the context of ETH 2.0 and deny that the flippening is coming very soon.
* Tech adoption:
   * NFTs are going to be an enormous part of the future. Everything about the technology just makes sense and solves so many problems. We will see house deeds, permits, digital assets, bonds, video game property, wills, maybe even voting systems... all take place on-chain. Many of these will be *side chains running on Ethereum*. NFTs also allow something really cool - physical and digital assets tying together. Imagine buying a concert ticket and later receiving an NFT of the band taking a crowd-facing selfie *at that concert*. Incredibly cool stuff. This is the future we are about to live in, and *very* soon.
   * After the ETH 2.0 merge, the Ethereum network will be world-changing technology, in fact, it is getting there already and we've not even taken off yet. People who aren't familiar with terms like ""L2 scaling"" and ""settlement layer"" won't be able to follow, but you'll have to believe the nerdy folks. This is big. Bigger than big. This will be the quiet superhighway beneath the world, and the profits it generates will go directly to those staking and hodling their ETH... that's *you.*

All of the coming benefits above are multiplicative with one another.

Multiplicative benefits are what cause parabolic growth.

**Some of my fun predictions as of 5/9/21:**

* Bitcoin is about to go on a Summer tear. I expect within a few months it will run up over 100%, and it may leave 5 digits for the last time. It will outperform ETH for a short period, but ETH will still dramatically outperform it over the next 8 months overall.
* Sometime in the next few weeks ETH will see a significant but temporary pullback or an extended stagnation. We really need to shake out some paper hands. My guess is that this happens between $4800 and $6000.
* By January 1st 2023, Eth will have spent a significant amount of time around $50,000. I'm making this claim assuming no catastrophic USD inflation. To make the point, I will also claim it will hit 12x its current value (as of 5/9/2021) relative to every fiat currency.
* By 2025 you will be able to use a wallet containing either [gwei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp) or [satoshis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp) to purchase almost *anything* that you can purchase with a debit card in 2021. Your house and car deeds will exist on a blockchain if you so desire. You will personally own NFTs, even if you currently think they are silly.

To conclude, it is my belief that the $10K ETH claim is made based on market cycle analysis alone. It doesn't even consider ETH 2.0, technology adoption, deflationary indicators, or market actualization. $10K is a joke, $10k will happen below the flippening. I believe those that permanently leave ETH at $10k will be haunted by that decision for the rest of their lives.

How many times have you heard ""is that another Bitcoin? I don't get involved in that crypto stuff."" The people saying this to you today will be putting ETH in their IRAs and 401Ks in a few years. You are not just early, you are *insanely* early. **Nobody outside the crypto community even knows what Ethereum is. Let me repeat that -** ***Ethereum is worth $400 billion, and the vast majority of all investors still don't even know what it is.***

$5K is a great price. $10k is a great price.

Will Proof of Stake turn ETH into the best Store of Value coin?,1514574586.0,"In 2018, I expect much of the conversation around Ethereum to center upon Proof of Stake.  For those of you who want to learn more about Proof of Stake, [this is a decent write-up.](https://www.ethnews.com/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-explained)  A core feature of Proof of Stake will be that miners are replaced by validators.  These validators will provide security for the network, by staking their ETH, and will be compensated by receiving a portion of the transaction fees expended on the Ethereum network.  If they behave badly, they will be penalized and have their stake slashed.

**Proof of Stake is anticipated to bring many benefits to the Ethereum network and to ETH token holders, including:**

- Dramatically reducing energy consumption (in contrast to proof of work, which is incredibly energy intensive)
- Eliminating the miner centralization problem
- Providing some scaling improvements and supporting the cheaper implementation of private transactions
- Paving the way for even more advanced scaling solutions
- Locking-up massive amounts of ETH supply (thus creating relative scarcity in circulating token supply)
- Allowing ETH to pay what essentially amounts to a dividend (for those with stake who also serve as validators)
- Imbuing ETH with financial value that is not purely based upon speculation, but also upon income (allowing for discounted cashflow analysis by professional investors)
- Catching Wall Street's attention (and possibly skyrocketing the price)

Here's the rub, ***in order for Proof of Stake to work, I believe the market must consider ETH to be a store of value token, in addition to being a smart contract utility coin.  And I believe that the Foundation and many of the smart people in the Ethereum community already realize this.***  This ""store of value"" label is one that the Foundation and many others in the community either avoid, or eschew in some cases for a variety of reasons.  Chief among them is that store of value implies mostly speculative value without much in the way of underlying fundamentals.  But the reality is that in order for Proof of Stake to work, ETH tokens must have meaningful value, and that value will be compared to other tokens in the marketplace.

Given how quickly the crypto market is evolving, Ethereum will have to compete for every unit of fiat-denominated wealth stored in its tokens.  And that very wealth is what will secure the network under Proof of Stake, in lieu of mining activity.  **Make no mistake: a higher ETH price will be directly correlated with greater network security.**

So let's take a look at the **characteristics that define a ""store of value"" token:**

- Provable scarcity, ideally with a hardcap, and/or proven track record of little to no inflation
- Sufficient network effect, reinforcing the store of value characteristic
- Not dependent upon other assets for their value
- Operate on a decentralized blockchain (ideally)
- Provide token fungibility (ideally)

And that's pretty much it.  You could even argue that the first point is the only one that is *really* needed.  Some of the popular store of value tokens offer differentiated value beyond this, such as private transactions or planned interoperability with faster L2 solutions.

**When Ethereum does implement Proof of Stake, it is expected to dramatically curtail or even halt token supply inflation- possibly even destroying some of the existing supply.**  Of course, this will need to be implemented to prove that it really meets this criteria (or hard coded in), but once it does, that first point will be met- possibly in a way that is superior to existing store of value coins.

Another important point is that **staking functionality makes ETH different from almost every other utility token on the market.**  Many utility tokens, which run on Ethereum as ERC-20s, will be high velocity tokens (i.e., changing hands often) and have no staking functionality.

For example: if you want to make a transaction on an exchange using the 0x protocol, you will first need to purchase and then spend some of the ZRX utility tokens.  If demand hits a sufficient level, then the price of ZRX may very well increase, due to insufficient liquidity for potential users of the platform.  *But this is very different from a staking model,* where the token's value is essential to operation and security of the network.  It doesn't matter how much a ZRX token is worth, that network can still function even with a paltry token value.

But this type of fixed utility, high velocity token would not be sufficient to run a Proof of Stake blockchain.  People must want to hold ETH, above and beyond its utility to purchase gas on the the Ethereum network.  ETH as a store of value token allows this, and its planned ""dividend"" from being a validator will only make this more attractive.  And we already know that ETH's gas price will be allowed to ""float"" separately from the value of ETH.

***So what does all of this mean?  Don't assume ETH is just another utility coin.  Don't assume it will never be a store of value coin.  On the contrary, I believe ETH's utility, combined with all of the factors I list above, will make ETH the most desirable store of value / smart contract utility coin on the market.  And I believe that smart investors today are already treating it as such.***"

Chin up boys and girls ‚Äì the DApps (Decentralized Apps) are finally coming. _**Utility**_, not speculation/manipulation/shilling etc., is what, in the end, will give/justify the value of blockchains.

&nbsp;

[Of the top 100 tokens, 91 of them are on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20).](https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/) The most valuable non-Ethereum tokens by market cap are USDT (4) and GAS (25). Eventually, ICX (6), VeChain (3) and EOS (1) and several others will be migrating to their own blockchains. Still, this leaves Ethereum with an overwhelming market dominance for tokens (aka DApps) and Ethereum has been clearly recognized as *the* blockchain to launch ICOs/DApps.

&nbsp;

We have already seen several DApps successfully launch on mainnet including [CrytptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [Crypto Sportz](https://cryptosportz.com/), [Edgeless](https://www.edgeless.io/), [Etherbots](https://etherbots.io/), [Ethercraft](https://ethercraft.io/), [Etheremon](https://www.etheremon.com/#/), [Etheroll](https://etheroll.com/), [ETHLend](https://ethlend.io/en/), [Forkdelta](https://forkdelta.github.io/) (RIP Etherdelta), [0xBitcoin](https://0xbitcoin.org/) and [Ethlance](https://ethlance.com/) among others. Check out a whole list on [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) and track the progress of some lesser known, smaller projects on [StateoftheDApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/) (**Note**: I cannot vouch for all of these DApps. There have been and always will be scammers in the crypto space. **Please**, always do your own research!)

&nbsp;



For the rest of March + Q2 (April - June) we are going see **the biggest implementation of DApps on the Ethereum mainnet to date.** Below I‚Äôve laid out, in alphabetical order and in varying detail, what‚Äôs happening between now and the end of Q2 of this year. (I‚Äôve also added some info, where especially relevant, of big stuff coming after Q2). I hope any biases I may have do not come through too much in the writing.

&nbsp;

To hammer home on utility once more: One year ago today, the daily transaction count was at 57,000. Yesterday, the network confirmed over 752,000 transactions (a 13x increase) (And remember, ATH in January was 1.349 million txns!)

[**MakerDAO**](https://makerdao.com/)

[Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/)

* MakerDao is a decentralized stable coin project that is currently live on mainnet. It is composed of two main parts: MKR and dai (both are ERC-20 tokens). 

* MKR is a governance token: ""MKR holders are the highest authority in the Maker system - they govern the system and benefit financially when they govern it well, but they also have to foot the bill if things are mismanaged - as a group they need strong social cooperation and a vigilant attitude towards governance.""

Some **general Ethereum** news to be excited about:

&nbsp;


* Vitalik recently hinted, in a since deleted tweet, that the sharding testnet will be coming online in the near future (I think Q2 isn‚Äôt too early a guess). 

 * What is sharding? Sharding is where the entire state of the network is split into a bunch of partitions called shards that contain their own independent piece of state and transaction history. In this system, certain nodes would process transactions only for certain shards, allowing the throughput of transactions processed in total across all shards to be much higher than having a single shard do all the work as the mainchain does now. [[Source]](https://medium.com/@rauljordan/how-to-scale-ethereum-sharding-explained-ba2e283b7fce) 

&nbsp;


* [Alpha Casper FFG testnet](https://hackmd.io/s/Hk6UiFU7z) has been successfully running since Dec. 31, 2017. 

 * What is Casper? Casper FFG aka Vitalik‚Äôs Casper is a hybrid POW/POS consensus mechanism. This is the version of Casper that is going to be implemented first. In a Proof of Stake system, validators stake a portion of their Ethers and start validating blocks. Meaning, when they discover a block which they think can be added to the chain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. [[Source]](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-casper/)

* [The Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC)](https://ethcc.io/) is March 8-10 in Paris. Talks will focus around ‚Äúscalability, anonymity, development tools, governance compliance‚Äù among other topics. 

 * Speakers include representatives from the Ethereum Foundation, Ledger, Metamask, Shapeshift, Oraclize, Uport, Web3Foundation, Melonport, ConsenSys, JP Morgan, Coinbase ‚Äì Toshi, Parity, SpankChain, FunFair, Aragon, AirSwap, EEA, IExec, Cosmos, OmiseGO, Circle, Gnosis, among others. 

 * **UPDATE**: EthCC was a resounding success! If you missed it or want to re-watch any of the talks, check out this [handy thread of videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/83mz5q/all_videos_from_ethcc_18_in_paris/), painstakingly culled and timestamped by u/alsomahler. 


* [The Ethereum Developer Conference (EDCON)](https://edcon.io/) is May 3-5 in Toronto. This will be the biggest ETH dev conference since DEVCON 3 last November. The agenda is still being worked out, but speakers include representatives from the Ethereum Foundation, Polkadot, Parity, Plasma, OmiseGO, Cosmos, Tendermint, Giveth, Maker, Gnosis, and many others. 

* The Enterprise Ethereum Foundation (EEF) just keeps [growing and growing and growing.](https://entethalliance.org/members/)

###More, because I just can‚Äôt stop:

 - MetaMask recently passed 1 million installs!
 - 5.6 billion requests per day for Infura.io (Decentralized web3 infrastructure)
 - 280,000 downloads of TruffleSuit (ETH development framework)

   [[Source]](https://twitter.com/ethereumJoseph/status/963054611237167106)

&nbsp;

* [ConsenSys](https://new.consensys.net/) has grown to over 600 employees in six major offices located around the world. I personally think ConsenSys is important (and awesome) because they are huge Ethereum evangelists and provide (in)valuable resources to help bring DApps come to life! 

 *   From their website: ‚ÄúThe ConsenSys ‚Äúhub‚Äù coordinates, incubates, accelerates and spawns ‚Äúspoke‚Äù ventures through development, resource sharing, acquisitions, investments and the formation of joint ventures. These spokes benefit from foundational components built by ConsenSys that enable new services and business models to be built on the blockchain.‚Äù


 * Several of the projects I listed above are ConSensys formations including AirSwap and MetaMask.

Thanks to its [adjustable ""block-size""](http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/12/11/ethereum-fees-fall-congestion-reduces) Ethereum already processes more transactions everyday than [all decentralised cryptos combined](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7erjvg/ethereum_is_now_processing_more_transactions_a), and Ethereum transactions are [faster and cheaper](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7m30n8/it_now_costs_one_gwei_for_a_transaction_to_send) than the few transactions processed by Bitcoin. It will grow even further once its updates [Casper](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/10/30/ethereum-casper-advance-launch) and [Sharding](http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/25/vitalik-buterin-lays-roadmap-ethereum-visa-levels-quadratic-sharding) are launched.

Ethereum's blockchain is [smaller than Bitcoin's](https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a) while hosting way more transactions, due to a better design.

microRaiden [has been released](https://github.com/raiden-network/microraiden/milestone/2), allowing for [thousands of instant and free transactions per second](https://raiden.network/micro.html) on Ethereum's network.

A first implementation [is running](http://notes.eth.sg/MYEwhswJwMzAtADgCwEYBM9kAYBGJ4wBTETKdGZdXAVmRvUQDYg=?view). Meanwhile, Bitcoin's consumption rises exponentially so [it will become a huge problem quickly](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05qgnhv) if it does not stop, and mining will be shut down by the Chinese government. Yes, 65% of Bitcoin's miners [are Chinese](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/bitcoin-mining-centralization). With Casper, everyone on Earth will have the resources to secure Ethereum with zero environmental impact.

The only plan for Bitcoin to grow and decrease its [unsustainable transaction fees](https://twitter.com/HeyRhett/status/944178314809348096) is a project called Lightning. Lightning has intrinsic flaws. First, it has serious [scaling issues](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/74ss0w/another_all_time_low_achieved_the_blockstream_cso/do0voa8) because millions of users imply that tons of changes per second must be broadcast and tons of routes recomputed every second, which is [impossible](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7n00gv/daily_general_discussion_december_30_2017/dryqkxc). Second, participants need to leave their computer [on permanently, with private keys on the hard disk](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7l5bqj/the_best_thing_that_you_can_do_to_help_ensure). That is against the security basics of Bitcoin: it makes massive hacks and thefts easy.
Third, using it requires [complicated, expensive and slow actions](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7nomn8/reasons_why_lightning_will_not_work).
Finally, if Lightning could work, it would anyway kill Bitcoin's point: *a decentralised network for censorship-proof transactions* (each person would open only one channel with a central hub that everyone connects to and transacts through, instead of peer to peer channels, because two transactions are needed to open and close a Lightning channel, which are very expensive).

So, among censorable networks, PayPal is clearly safer and simpler than Bitcoin's Lightning (and it can scale up). In contrast, Ethereum designed scaling plans ensuring security, usage simplicity and decentralisation: [Casper](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/10/30/ethereum-casper-advance-launch) (about 10 times faster than BTC) and  [Sharding](http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/25/vitalik-buterin-lays-roadmap-ethereum-visa-levels-quadratic-sharding) (hundreds times faster).

ETH Futures start trading [before June 2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-16/ether-derivatives-are-coming-from-a-pioneer-of-credit-swaps).

Bitcoin is [abandoned by numerous companies](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/68822h/a_list_of_companies_which_used_bitcoin_and) because of its [unreliable and dangerous developer team](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp) as well as high transaction delays and [unsustainable fees](https://twitter.com/HeyRhett/status/944178314809348096). Instead, thousands of developers and [hundreds of companies](https://entethalliance.org/members) are adopting Ethereum."

"[SCAM ACCUSATION] HitBTC.com Scam - Stolen Tokens worth 150 ETH ($50,000 USD)",1503669693.0,"**CONFIRMED - HITBTC IS A SCAM**

**UPDATE 3rd NOV 2017**
**HitBTC being served with subpoena's** 

This will be my last update. HitBTC has completely scammed me, they reply publicly and pretend to be resolving the issue, or say it's resolved or to check the ticket, it's a lie. They use any mistake you make, a trading one, an account profile one to steal your funds, they stole $130K USD from someone else, I have in excess of 40 messages on my Reddit account of victims from HitBTC.

I can no longer further comment my lawyers are commencing legal action on Monday against the known serviced addresses, and shell company addresses, in an attempt to get the real owners behind the operation. We are also applying to a judge to have their bank account frozen, we believe their bank should hold KYC information on the actual owners - not fake nominee directors, that is the hope. 

Once we have this information my lawyers will be perusing arrest warrants for all the directors it doesn't matter where they are in the world HK, or DK, where-ever they are my lawyers have offices and I am perusing this, client account funded. 

**If you are thinking about using HitBTC, don't you will loose your money**, just do a quick Google search, they skim money on the side if you use the API, or outright steal from you should you loose your 2FA, email address, or anything else. AVOID THEM. No registered address, and serviced addresses with no license to operate, WHOIS hidden on their domain. They are complete scam, yes they may list tokens first, but don't get lured in use a trustworthy exchange I have lost $44,700 as a result of this, they reply to tickets, and just road block you - asking for one thing after another, non stop road blocking. My money is lost, but you have a choice you don't need to loose yours too, dont use the exchange, HitBTC is a SCAM. 

-- History -- 

**UPDATE 1st NOV 2017**
They have stolen the funds, completely. They made me jump through hops promising they would unlock it, then they dont. My last ticket reply: 

In my first ever tickets I proved I owned the ETH wallet that funded the account, and only asked for the funds to be withdrawen to the only wallet ever withdrawn too, they disregarded my comments.

1. They said send ID we will remove email lock, I did.
2. They then said enable 2FA and you can withdraw, I did.
3. Now they are saying do you have access to the ETH wallet that funded the account, delaying tacit of a scammer.

They have proven themselves as con artists, absolute scammers. 

My last reply to them: 


Paola,

If you check the original tickets, I proved I owned the ETH wallet that funded the account - when I opened a ticket I sent another small amount. Infact you disregarded my comments saying anything could have sent the funds, I have quoted you exactly on this matter. 

I PROVED WHEN I OPENED THE FIRST TICKET REGARDING THIS THAT I OWNED THE ADDRESSES BOTH THE ONE THAT FUNDED IT, AND THE ONE THAT WITHDREW TOO. 

1. Yes I proved I owned the account that funded the ETH -  I sent a small amount to prove I owned the wallet that funded the account when I opened the ticket and said so, you disregarded this saying anyone could have funded it hence why we needed your ID. We are back at stage one - you are delaying like scammers.

2. I originally said just withdraw to the only withdrawal address I have ever used, you too disregarded this, and demanded ID. 

I have the information from bank on the directors of the shady company behind HitBTC. I will proceed legally against your directors even if they are nominee directors they'll give up the real owners pretty soon as soon as they are arrested unless you unlock my account and remove the withdrawal lock, I have proven I owned the wallets you disregarded that - I have all the tickets saved - feel free to have a read. 

Listen I'm now convinced you are a scam, you said send us ID then we'll disable email confirmation and you can withdraw to where ever - then you said no, enable 2FA, I have done both, disable email withdrawal confirmations like you promised.

My deadline is Friday, I know you are not going to release my account funds but you have a choice, if suddenly the original wallet that funded matters to you even though in a dozen tickets you said it could be anyone and I have quoted you below how about this

1. Send all my tokens to the ETH address that funded the wallet - I'd rather you not have the funds, and me neither - you thieving scammers.

2. Disable e-mail confirmations like you said you would and let me withdraw my money. 

TO QUOTE YOURSELF IN TICKET ID - 233XX

Paola Balzano:
""We don't know that that ETH address belongs to you or anyone else. How could we know that? We believe that, but don't know.
And also we believe that confirming your identity is the only way for us to make sure that your funds are safe. Because at least we would know who has withdrawn them.""


In Ticket ID - 233XX

Me:
""To confirm ownership of my account I have done the following.

1. I just made a 0.X ETH deposit from the same address that made previous ETH deposits, it was sent from 0xdXXXXXX into my deposit address here '0xaXXXXXX' this is the same sender wallet I have used every time.""


I HAVE PROVEN MY IDENTITY
I HAVE ENABLED 2FA
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU ASKED

ANY FURTHER DELAYING ONLY CONFIRMS THAT YOU ARE A SCAM. I HAVE ARCHIVED ALL OF THE SUPPORT TICKETS, I HAVE INFORMATION ON THE OWNERS AND THE SHADY SHELL COMPANIES, YOUR BANK AND THE KYC INFORMATION ON THE DIRECTOR. 

I WILL PUBLISH THIS. 

Unless you release the e-mail withdrawal lock like you promised, instead of constantly delaying and acting like scammers, which I have already accepted I have lost the funds you have my word, my promise, I will pursue you legally and all your directors I will bury your bank in legal action and apply to have the accounts frozen. 

I have done everything you asked for and you keep delaying, a scammers tactic. 

Just release the email withdrawal lock, or admit you are thieving scammers and if suddenly the ETH account that funded the wallet matters so much to you after you disregarded it, send the funds there - I'd rather it sit in a wallet I dont have access to than you thieving ba***rds have access to it. 



** UPDATE 29th October 2017 **

This is still not resolved, they keep deploying delaying tactics and contradicting themselves. 

HitBTC is now doing delaying tactics, common of that of a scam. They dismissed publicly and in my tickets saying that anyone could own the address that funded the account - so they said I needed to send them ID and a selfie, and a selfie with the ticket open, of which I did, they then said I needed to enable 2FA and then as soon as I did that they would disable email authentication so that I would be able to withdraw.

Now they are saying ""Do you own the ETH address that funded the account"" after about a dozen tickets of me originally saying that I owned it, now I moved my funds onto another wallet and they are now saying ""Do you have access to the ETH address that funded the account""

This is after promising they would remove the email confirmation to withdraw if I provided them ID and enabled 2FA, of which I did.

A stalling tatic. 

**It's safe to say HitBTC IS A SCAM.**

IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE OWNERS, AND THIS SITUATION IS NOT RESOLVED BY FRIDAY I WILL START A WEBSITE AND PUBLISH ALL THE INFORMATION I HAVE ON THE OWNERS AND HAVE AN ADWORDS CAMPAIGN SO ANYONE SEARCHING HITBTC ON GOOGLE WILL SEE BEWARE HITBTC IS A SCAM.  

**UPDATE: 15th October 2017. **
This is still not resolved. My lawyers advise was to provide them with my passport, of which would be required anyway to confirm my identity. I am going to provide this and will let you know if they release the funds or not. /u/hitbtc /u/


**UPDATE 16th October 2016.** 

I have provided them with the following: 

1. a close up and clearly visible photo of your passport/national ID (as Paola has already mentioned, you are free to cover all the unnecessary information, you can also put watermarks);

2. a clearly visible photo of you in front of your computer with this ticket opened.

3. A photo of me holding a letter begging them to give my money back

4. A photo of me holding my passport, my laptop with the ticket open, and a QR code begging me for my money back.

Please release this lock. This has gone on long enough, I proved I owned the ETH wallet, I proved I owned were all the previous withdrawals were from. /u/hitbtc unrestrict my account I have already lost tens of thousands. 

**IF WHAT THEY ASK IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH CLEARLY THEY ARE ABOUT TO EXIT SCAM. I AM ALREADY THOUSANDS DOWN AS I HAVE HAD MY FUNDS LOCKED AWAY**

I will remove this thread if they remove the email lock or update the email to my working one.

**UPDATE 17th October.** 

They said they would remove the 2FA. Nothing yet. 
Very fishy. 

**UPDATE 16th October 2016.** 

They are ignoring and closing tickets, 6-7 tickets closed. No reply in my actual support ticket. 

**UPDATE 19th October 2016.** 

They said ""Hi there! We hope you'd forgive us for this experience. This issue will be resolved today or tomorrow, and we will keep you informed."" they still have not enabled withdrawals or updated my email address. 

No reply to support tickets still. 

---

Please be extremely cautious, if you have funds on this exchange it's advised you move them to a wallet that you control. At a moments notice HitBTC can decide they are going to keep your funds. 

Anyone else who has a grievance against HitBTC is advised to contact me by private message, more evidence is welcome in the claim I am making against the director (be it a nominee director they'll quickly give up the real owner) we will also get our lawyers to contact the banks to find out who is the signatory on the account.

Stay tuned. You know the ticket ID Ticket ID: 233XX

----
UPDATE 26/08/2017:

HitBTC are refusing to return the tokens, even though I can prove I own the wallet that funded the account, My IP is the same, and I am requesting it be withdrawn to the same address I have always used. 

I contacted lawyers in China on Friday and have requested their legal address and company number in my support ticket.

My e-mail account being deleted was out of my control, the fact withdrawals did not work for days on end was not my fault. 

In discussions with YouTuber's if anyone wants to make a video please get in contact the world needs to know about HitBTC, if they stole 50k I will happily spend 50k to highlight this fact and cause them more than they've stolen from me. 

Anyone with a website please contact me, blog, etc. 

----

Their withdrawals were disabled.
They randomly enabled 2FA. 
My e-mail provider decided to delete my account.

I have: 

1. Requested balance withdrawn to the same withdrawal address I have always used, since day 0 of owning the account. 
2. Proved I own the wallet that funded the account, verifiable by block chain. 
3. Am logged in with the same IP address used on the day of account creation. 

They are refusing to return the tokens. SCAM BEWARE. NO COMMON SENSE AT ALL. 


----

OK. Let's apply some basic logic here.
*CONCERN 1:* Your concern is that someone could have logged into the account, and requested a withdrawal right? And the original account owner will come along and start a post on reddit saying e-mail 2FA disabled lost my money, that was your claim.
*ANSWER 1:* I am only requesting you withdraw to the SAME address used previously, the only one ever used. If I am someone else, I am sending the funds to the ORIGINAL OWNER of the account as it's the same bloody address.
*CONCERN 2:* We don't know you are the account owner.
*ANSWER 2:* I have proven I am the owner by indisputable facts, I own the wallet that funded the HitBTC account - verifiable by blockchain. I have sent a deposit of 0.1 when I opened this ticket to my account. No one in the world has the private keys but me, thats the way this stuff works. I own the wallet that funded the account.
*ANSWER 3:* Check my IP address, it's the same as the day the account was created.
Please can you answer these facts? Or are you just wanting to steal my money? /u/hitbtc

I would like to make the Reddit Crypto community aware that HitBTC.com has in effect stolen 150 ETH from myself and at the time of this post that is $50,000 USD. 

I understand this is partially my fault but it's no excuse for the lack of support.

On the 2017-08-20 I decided to buy DNT, I deposited 200 ETH worth, at the time that being $59,942.62 and withdrew the DNT tokens no problem. Happy with my purchase I thought I would also buy the ZRX token, so I deposited 150 ETH to buy ZRX. I purchased the ZRX (and got a terrible rate) however when I went to withdraw the ZRX it said due to technical issues I was unable to withdraw ZRX at that time. No problem I will return later. 

I returned yesterday and attempted to withdraw my 50k USD (150 ETH) worth of ZRX to my token wallet, the same one I used for my DNT withdrawal, the only one ever used on my HitBTC account. 

This is when I get an alert saying confirm withdrawal by e-mail, uh oh. I used a free email address, which was disabled by the e-mail provider as I didn't use a real name or details, my fault I know right? However 2FA was never enabled, and suddenly it was. No problem I will contact support. 

Support isn't being helpful, I requested withdrawal or an e-mail address change. 

1. I have proved ownership of the ETH wallet that funded the account, it has in excess of $XXXk USD. I sent a verification deposit of 0.1 ETH to my HitBTC account, to show I am the original person who funded the account. What more do they want?

2. I am requesting to withdraw all my ZRX tokens to the same address I have ALWAYS used, the only address I have used not a different one. The ONLY ADDRESS ever withdrawn too on this account NOT a different one.

3. My IP address is the same as the day I opened the account. 

4. I wouldn't be in this situation if 2FA Email Confirmation hadn't been randomly enabled.

5. I wouldn't be in this situation if ZRX withdrawals were working, I would have withdrawn them straight away on the day I purchased them.

I am getting nowhere with HitBTC support, I have hit a brick wall. I am not sure if this is a deliberate attempt to steal my funds or just bad service, there is no common sense just canned replies anyone else can see I am the person who created the account I have access to the wallet that funded it, the one I withdrew too in the past, and I am asking it to be sent to the same wallet I withdrew 200 ETH worth of DNT too, not a random address. 

Until this situation is resolved I would just warn others to be careful and not do large deposits to HitBTC. I wouldn't be in this issue had 2FA been randomly enabled or if ZRX withdrawals were working the day I bought them, not days later. 

Yes I understand I shoudln't have used a free email address but it's easy enough for them to update my e-mail address or process the withdrawal to the only address I have ever used and withdrawn successfully too in the past. 

I'm unable to find what country they are incoporated in, nor have they answered my requests for their legal address and incoporisation number of their company. Very shady, beware. 

If a staff member wants me to provide evidence to this I can provide screenshots, the transaction, my wallet with in excess of XXXk USD worth in it, etc.

Say anything remotely negative about ETH, or positive about BTC, and you get downvoted into oblivion. I got downvoted for saying to take some profits at 700. I got downvoted for saying BTC might be breaking out soon.

I'm all for Ethereum - I do believe it is the future, web 3.0. However, be reasonable and think for yourselves for once. It's okay to have different opinions. Save downvotes for complete garbage and spam. Give different opinions a chance to see daylight so that we might gain valuable insights and ground ourselves.

6 of 10 Moderators are leaving Ethtrader. A farewell.,1566167242.0," 

As a moderator team, we have tried working good faith with Carl (‚Äúlead mod‚Äù for this sub) for the past year and beyond to benefit r/EthTrader as a community, however, this has grown increasingly challenging due to consistently unilateral, and ostensibly self-serving decisions which he has made that degrade the quality of the sub.  
 Over the past week, this culminated in shocking and unilateral decisions by Carl to remove two long-time moderators over a minor, unsettled, disagreement on an administrative issue which was still under open discussion. In this unprecedented action, Carl unilaterally stripped u/AdamSC1 and then u/jtnichol of all moderator authorities and permissions. Combined with continual opaque behavior in engagement with Reddit around Donuts, and generally unproductive communication with the broader moderator team on on-going operational issues, we feel we have no choice but to step down as moderators of r/ethtrader as a result of these actions.

Ethereum is about decentralization and community consensus. We believe strongly in the Ethereum community, its users, developers, investors, and trading community - that was why many of us worked hard to build /r/EthTrader in the first place.  
 

Given recent events, we no longer feel it is possible to maintain a quality Moderator team here in r/EthTrader where one individual wields unilateral authority. As a result, the majority of the current moderator team is resigning effective immediately and will work to create a new sub, Twitter, and Discord called /r/EthFinance.

This new Reddit sub will be a high quality forum for all Ethereum-related discussions. It will be well-moderated by a team of veterans and equals who will work together to make decisions around the direction of the sub, and it will have the support of many prominent community members.  With the support of our sister Twitter handle and Discord vectors, we hope to make a place for everyone to join in the discussion.

Walking away from r/EthTrader, was not an easy decision for us.  All of us have invested years into growing and sustaining this community., But we could no longer stand-by the repeated unilateral decisions eroding the fabric of this community.

We hope you choose to join us, as we move forward in creating a proactive, positive community that can serve as a shining example of the values that Ethereum and blockchain stands for.

I can tell you right now, there is no sweeter feeling in life I‚Äôve experienced than truly accomplishing financial independence.

Please stop tipping /u/sharpshaaman. It's very likely his ER visit post is fake.,1495288762.0,"Original post here: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6c673h/thank_you_to_everyone_eth_has_given_me_the_money/

He submits a very heartfelt sob story about his father being sent to the ER, and with the family's poor insurance, /u/sharpshaaman would be able to help since he threw all his money into 100 ETH a few months ago (originally $1100, this morning ~$11,240.  He was so happy about the payoff he:

> I told my mom for the first time about the extra funds I had and the relief I saw on her face was completely worth the dumb gamble I made without doing any research

**Only problem is his mom supposedly [died ~8 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/52ii32/college_student_and_i_need_to_turn_1600_into_4500/).**  Does this sob story sound familiar?  

>I want to say thanks first of all if you're reading this, it's been a real rough couple of months. I'm 18 and just started college for Mechanical Engineering, my mother managed to pay my first semester of tuition, $4500, but she recently passed. My dad took ownership of the house, put it up for sale and moved to Seattle. I work at Dominos and working as much as I can am able to make about $600 a month, my rent is $700/month and that's not including gas or my food expense (I don't have a meal plan). As for my assets, I have a car that I could sell for about $2000 and $1647 in my savings. My phone bill is also $40/month, I have an iPhone 6 that I could sell for maybe $300 as well. I've been trying a lot of things, penny stock investing, attempting to sell out websites (search engine optimization), making an app, I'm even desperately trying to make a booty page on Instagram to get a bunch of followers and advertise other people's accounts (Dumb but whatever it takes, I dont really care). I've seen a little bit of success in the stock market by day trading penny stock through ustocktrade, however I don't currently have the knowledge and therefore the confidence to risk all my assets on unpredictable over the counter stocks. And advice is appreciated, as much as I hate my position I'm excited to see how it all turns out.

8 days before that post, [another sob story about his friend throwing his wallet into a lake and having no cash and no gas in his tank](https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/514wfi/stranded_with_35_in_my_paypal_what_can_i_do/).

Here's a lovely post about [shoplifting 2 Fitbits from a Kohl's and a Walmart](https://np.reddit.com/r/Shoplifting/comments/5er9ac/fitbit_haul/).

And a final one from 7 days ago (same father to ER story) where he was [locked out of his car and left his credit card at the hospital](https://np.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/6awxma/always_pay_it_forward_to_your_fellow_men/).  

He also has some very interesting anti-feminist and anti-women comments in his history.

I love the generosity of this sub, but I hate to see its users taken advantage of.  Anyone who has frequented the daily discussion thread the past few days knows that, after the creation of the tip jar bot, we've seen a bit of an explosion of ""please tip me"" or other kinds of comments.  Yes, each tip is a small amount of money, but posts like /u/sharpshaaman's, when they really get mainstream, have the potential of yielding substantial amounts of money.  I mean hell the top comment is from a Kraken employee offering him a *real-world* internship.  I'm sure /u/kraken-colin would love to know about his shoplifting history before offering the internship.

It sounds like this guy probably is a broke college student who's trying multiple avenues of scrounging up as much cash as he can in as short a time period as possible to get rich quick, whether that means shoplifting or posting sob stories on /r/ethtrader, /r/personalfinance, or /r/MGTOW (basically /r/MensRights, anti-feminist).  In the grand scheme of things, a $5 donation isn't going to break the bank.  But please be sure about the reason you're donating so this sub doesn't turn into people abusing the tip bot for extra cash.

Eth price is deliberately sabotaged,1509391555.0,"Hey, 
This is not a rant from an Eth holder as I am more of a daytrader and I observe some of the currencies. I don't own any eth.

Each time there is an indecision  (end of a triangle, tightening of bollinger bands, testing of a support line, or whatever strategic moment):

-Giant sell wall with absolutely nothing to gain from being here comes from nowhere

-""Painting"" happening on GDAX with bots spaming many small sell order (famous 0.001627) for each buy order, this has an anxiogenic intent as the history looks entirely red.

-Multiple limit sell order appearing then disapearing (the same ones) creating the illusion of very active selling motion.

This is done to induces a psychological habituation that Eth will dump when BTC dump and Eth will not rise when BTC pump.

Since it happens to be a recurrent manipulation, I do think now that it is NOT tactical but a long term strategy to make the second capitalisation, to STAY the second one by a long way.
I really think there is a currency war going on and some people are too naive to figure that, and they think ""tech"" and updates is the key to success, and as you can see nowadays it is not the only thing that matter!!

I just cannot be the only one to have observed this.

This screenshot shows the end of a triangle (decisive moment), testing a support, giant sell wall appeared, discouraging everyone and the resistance broke.

On this one you can see the selling script, but I wittnessed more relevant actions on GDAX with a script who counterattacke like 6 small selling for a buy, you can also see the giant wall on that one:

""" Ethereum has already won the race for developer mindshare. Several orders of magnitude more developers than any other platform. And if you don't have developers building on your platform, you're building a ghost town. "" James Duffy, Loom Network",1525891363.0,"Great AMA here from Loom: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8i4iir/hi_rethereum_we_are_loom_network_and_were_helping/

Also see: 

https://medium.com/loom-network/scalability-tradeoffs-why-the-ethereum-killer-hasnt-arrived-yet-8f60a88e46c0

"" I think the real question is, what other blockchain would we have built on if not Ethereum? There's not really a credible alternative.

- Ethereum has several orders of magnitude more developers than any other platform. And if you don't have developers building on your platform, you're building a ghost town.

- Ethereum is sufficiently decentralized, which is necessary for a base layer. Other blockchains that claim to be cheaper / faster than Ethereum, it's typically because either a) no one is using them so there's low competition for transaction fees, or b) they've sacrificed decentralization by design in order to increase throughput. See our post on the subject.

- As far as we're concerned, Ethereum has already won the race for developer mindshare, and with so many active projects in the developer community like Web3.js, MetaMask, Infura, Truffle, Trustwallet, etc. (it's a long list), it's going to be extremely difficult for another platform to catch up.

- It's possible that another blockchain platform will spring up at some point in the future that's 10x better, and if enough of our users demand it we can add support for another blockchain. But we wouldn't bet on it.

- Plus, any additional features another blockchain might offer such as gas-less transactions, low-latency transactions, or higher transaction throughput, can simply be implemented as Level 2 services on top of Ethereum (like Loom) rather than building a new base layer from scratch. ""

Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup just Bought Poloniex,1519653066.0,"""That‚Äôs just the start. Now Circle is preparing to take another major leap forward by tacking on an entirely new business as part of its underlying market infrastructure. On Monday Circle will announce, as Fortune can confirm for the first time, that it has bought Poloniex, one of the world‚Äôs most active cryptocurrency exchanges. A person familiar with the terms of the deal who was not authorized to speak about it tells Fortune that the price tag comes in around $400 million.

The acquisition will instantly make Circle a rising threat to Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., as well as Bittrex and Kraken, the runner-ups. Counting contributions from Poloniex, Circle‚Äôs revenues over the past three months, excluding February, exceeded $250 million, placing the company on an annual run rate greater than $1 billion. Not bad for a 5-year-old upstart.

With the expansion, Circle is laying the groundwork for a day when cryptocurrencies become pervasive, prices grow less volatile, and the utility of digital tokens goes undisputed. If most of the dozens of exchanges competing today are just places to buy and sell coins, Circle has loftier ambitions: It wants to eventually help consumers turn their trading profits into a Tesla, a mortgage, or a portfolio of blue chips. Circle has ample funds, mainstream investors, sophisticated tech, a new network of customers annexed from Poloniex‚Äîand, with some luck, a legitimate chance at building the bank of the next century around crypto-finance.""

Ethereum to the Moon üöÄ,1613985648.0,
A little explanation for what is happening today,1621189454.0,"Shortest TLDR of all time - This dip is still the aftermath of Elon's FUD. Elon triggered the dip, but it was coming anyway.

This happened when Bitcoin was hitting critical support levels, and now we are seeing a *temporary lapse in the ongoing Bull market.* Before we get into it, just be aware that this sort of event has happened before, many times.

Why the dip is happening:

1. People traditionally use the combination of Bitcoins 21 week EMA and 20 week SMA to find what they call a ""bull market support band"".
2. When Bitcoin is not above at least one of these two levels, it is seen as a reliable indicator that the entire crypto market is due for a correction. Every time this happens in a Bull market, we see a dip. A move like this usually precedes upward movement by BTC, followed shortly after by a larger move from ETH.
3. Elon trashed Bitcoin *specifically*, driving Bitcoin down below these levels, where it is currently sitting. This was the red flag for many traders to sell a local top, sparking a dump.
4. Due to speculation on this being the end of the bull market (it isn't) we are seeing the dip. We may continue to fall until Bitcoin again breaks back into its support band. The expectations for EIP-1559 in July may mitigate a lot of the downside for ETH, but we can't know.
5. Typically a breach of the bull market support band lasts about a week. We are on day 5.

What you should do:

1. **Do not FOMO into selling a local top** with the intent to rebuy at the bottom of the dip. Unless you're a skilled TA, or just really lucky, you have a high chance to screw this up, trigger a tax event, and pay fees twice. Remember the difference between short and long term capital gains is about 10% of your total profit! It's not worth the risk if you were here for the long term already.
2. Watch Bitcoin if you're looking to buy in. When Bitcoin starts to see support again, ETH has a really high chance to jump +25% in a matter of days.
3. Everyone has diamond hands until things get shaky. Just remember ""The market is a tool to transfer wealth from the impatient, to the patient."" For the sake of your own wellbeing, do not sell low.
4. We will go back up and set new all time highs, this is something that *literally nobody* debates, so close your chart, and relax!

**EDIT:** Watching live! As of 8:20PM CDT, after a bounce 2 hours prior, BTC is not currently holding the support band at around $46K. This dip may continue. I will keep watching!

This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, make your own decisions, you know the drill.

Take care all ‚úå"

Puerto Rico was the focus of most western media and as such, does not have a shortage of people to assist. If you can make this work, please consider donating your time/energy/efforts to the Virgin Islands first.

Thank you all for the overwhelming amount of support and interest. We can turn this community into a service for greater good and not only raise global awareness for ethereum, but make this world a better place.

I recently made the decision to come to Puerto Rico for a prospect in the crypto space. I've been researching volunteer opportunities and stumbled upon a pretty great one if anyone is interested. It includes free accommodation, meals and free round trip ticket from mainland US for volunteering 2 weeks or more.

Although the hurricane coverage has fallen out of the media spotlight, the devastation is still very much present. As early as the flight into San Juan, you can see people's homes covering their swept away roofs with blue tarps. Many of the interior cities are inaccessible being blocked by rubble and are still without power.  Major resorts, hotels, and lodges are booked out with FEMA contractors still working tirelessly to get America's Carribean colony back up and running. Even with all this, Puerto Ricans still continue to smile and have shown me nothing but the highest level of hospitality. 

Let's be better than what Consensus has portrayed us to be. We have a real opportunity here to make the world a better place not just with the adoption of blockchain technology, but also with what we can do with new found wealth and Independence. 

God bless the financial revolution

"If you understand why crypto is so volatile, the dips aren't so scary",1517895189.0,"These swings are gut-wrenching and this one is particularly gruesome. However, as some have pointed out... these happen with relative frequency in crypto land and every single violent dip has (eventually) been met with a return to ATHs. 

I find the dips aren't so scary if you stop and understand why crypto is uniquely insane with volatility.

1. Crypto's market cap is still small compared to, say, global stocks. Total crypto market cap is $278 billion right now. Apple almost has that much *cash on hand*. This lack of inertia means it can fly all over the place. 
2. Crypto is basically completely unregulated. That means money can come and go extremely rapidly. In most markets, large banks have to account for what they are doing most of the time. This red tape provides a degree of smoothing you don't get in crypto.
3. Crypto investors are relatively young and emotional, leading to exaggerated panic selling and FOMO. Seasoned investors have emotions too, but act more methodically. They would, for instance, have scheduled accumulation or divestment plans rather than waking up one day and saying 'oh shit' and pressing the sell (or buy) button. 
4. Crypto investors are relatively young and inexperienced. Rather than focus on fundamentals like developer mindshare, network effects, scalability, roadmaps, etc and make long term bets based on them, they're just chasing hot numbers and looking to get rich overnight. I would venture to guess many young traders didn't even factor in taxes when trading during 2017, which may be the true cause of this panic selloff; folks are having to liquidate completely just to pay the tax man.

There are probably more, but these are the big ones. 

The good news is that none of this undermines the central promise of cryptocurrency or Ethereum.

1. Crypto took off because people woke up to its power: autonomous computational services. DNS with no ICANN. Casinos with House. Checking accounts with no bank. This is a big, big, BIG deal from an innovation perspective and everyone knows it.
2. Ethereum is *by far* the coin best-positioned to capitalize due to its existing network effects (primarily developer mindshare at this point), true scarcity (thanks to network effects), strong governance, and coming scalability and privacy improvements. 
3. Whichever coin leads will REALLY lead. It won't be like ""oh we have Ford and GM and Toyota that are all relatively equal"". It will be like Facebook or the Internet itself... network effect dominant.
4. Unlike the late 90s internet, crypto is poised to roll out much faster. The dot com bust happened at a time when the necessary infrastructure simply wasn't there yet and wouldn't be for a decade. We had no broadband and no smartphones. Web 2.0 wasn't even a thing yet... the web was basically still brochureware and some very rudimentary e-commerce. With crypto, there is no hard infrastructure to build. It's already here. We just need CASPER and z-Snarks and what not to be hard-forked in and we're off to the races. There is hard work to be done around UX, security, scams, etc but the road looks a lot easier than building a global IP network to handle trillions of packets a day. 

I'm still a holder of Eth as i have been through all previous downturns. I've watched millions come and go and honestly, with some gains in fiat, these things don't rattle me anymore. I believe in the tech wholeheartedly and think you should too.

When friends ask me about ETH reaching 10K,1624973109.0,
3000 coming soon.,1613282858.0,
Thanks r/ethtrader! I think I've reached my moon and give-up my HODLER status,1514261137.0,"I heard about BTC and crypto years before. Some guy from Romania wanted to give me some BTC for some DOTA 2 beta keys I owned back in 2011. He posted the offer in PlayDotA and I shrugged it off because it was a big jargon for me back then. Ethereum however, I got acquainted with ETH and the initial feelings I had for it was hate. I was trying to build my dream PC back in April and I had so much trouble finding AMD RX 480 due to the mining craze. I had to go to the computer center really early every day to get a GPU only to find out that the shipment for the day were all pre-purchased by Chinese expats here in the Philippines. 

I read about BTC, ETH, and the cryptocurrency in general and I found the idea of ETH revolutionary. I swore that once we have the local exchanges here open ETH, I'll immediately buy and join the ETH community. It was announced that during November, one of our local crypto wallets (ABRA) added support for ETH and I was finally able to purchase ETH with my 13th month pay (Christmas bonus). I was able to purchase 0.33853342 of ETH at PHP 22,041 (USD 460). I was into the HODL stuff until I called my mother yesterday on Christmas day. 

My mother was diagnosed with stroke 2 years ago which made me quit my undergrad course and work in a call center. I had an arrangement with the hospital to pay all the expenses in 3 years after a month-long negotiation with the board. My mother was essentially on a one-month hospital arrest back in 2015. Yesterday's phone call however, she said that she is very excited with me being home for the New Year celebration. She said that this could possibly be our last New Year's eve together due to the complications brought by the stroke. She also asked me if I could fulfill her lifelong dream of being able to board an airplane and experience flying. This crushed my heart and that was when I decided to cash out my ETH balance today before I go home tomorrow. Thanks to ETH, I would be able to have her nails and hair done before we board that plane to Baguio City. The journey with ETH could be short, but it was worth it. My moon is taking my mom to the sky.

Happy New Year r/ethtrader and keep HODLING!

How About We NOT Brigade Online Businesses to Accept Ethereum?,1499152545.0,"Nevermind the logistics behind *how* we would get a place like Amazon to accept ETH as payment--but what's the point besides a quick price pump?

1. ETH is not designed to be a currency; it is a usage token.
2. ETH is not ready to scale to the size required for such payment.
3. Why would anyone spend their ETH today when they think it will be worth twice as much tomorrow? 
4. Did Bitcoin teach us nothing? It typically works like this:

* Brigade a company's customer service to accept ~bitcoin~ Ethereum
* They give in, set it up, and decide to accept (maybe)
* No one spends their Ethereum because we are Holders
* Said company quietly phases out their acceptance after a few months--because no one uses it.

You want to get it listed on exchanges? AWESOME! Let's do it! More liquidity for what most of us ACTUALLY USE ETH for! 

I can't do this anymore. The glory days of /r/ethtrader are long gone. "
High potential ICOs this week,1508164312.0,"Considering the weekly ICO thread is ridiculously difficult to navigate through, I figured I‚Äôd summarize this week's ICO thread before the next one goes up. I‚Äôm only including ICOs who have raised under 80-100 million USD (ideally in the 10-40 million range), as this seems to be the sweet spot where you actually have room to see decent gains. 

[Request Network](https://request.network) - By the time I‚Äôm done writing this post their ICO is likely to be finished. However, this project is definitely pretty promising and raising a reasonable sum of money to accomplish what they‚Äôre setting out to do. It was also mentioned so many damn times in the ICO thread that I can‚Äôt possibly leave it out of this post. Quoting people from that thread, this ICO could likely be a homerun - and I agree that there‚Äôs massive potential here in both the short-term and long-term. 

[EnjinCoin](https://www.enjincoin.io) - ICO is just about done. These guys know what they‚Äôre doing, and their coin actually has a use. They‚Äôre a well-established community with strong backers, and they‚Äôre raising 25 million in their ICO which is reasonable compared to other projects. The gaming market is huge and no project has really tackled it yet, so Enjin has potential to be one of the pioneers. 

[Ripio](https://ripiocredit.network/) - ICO on October 24th. They were mentioned a couple times in the ICO thread, and they‚Äôre also an existing company which is a nice plus. It‚Äôs a credit network that facilitates lending between two peers using smart contracts. Really cool concept, imo. 

[Grid+](https://gridplus.io) - I was hesitant to mention this project due to the nearly 100 million dollar market cap, but that 64-page white paper and massive partnerships shows that this could be one the really big projects in this space in the coming months. It‚Äôs also an interesting concept and there aren‚Äôt any energy blockchain startups that have been as big as this one yet. 

[Airswap](https://airswap.io) - Honorable mention to this one as the ICO is over now, but it‚Äôs another decentralized exchange. Still could potentially be successful, one to watch out for when they launch.

Cindicator - ICO just finished, started trading already. Heard there have been issues with the Telegram though. 

Considering ICOs are still largely profitable if you find the right ones (raising millions in hours in some cases), I think it‚Äôs beneficial for us to discuss them openly here. Feel free to suggest or de-suggest more projects and I‚Äôll add/remove them from this list as necessary."

Why I still think Ethereum will pass Bitcoin and never look back,1545667272.0,"I'm in crypto since the birth of BTC. About 2 to 3 years ago, when Ethereum was traded at 1 USD (yes) I moved all my BTC to ETH and didn't look back. From then to now, I've watched my small investment grow to millions in almost no time. I didn't sell a cent, I didn't even move my Eth at all, even after watching it go from 1400 back to 80 usd again. Why? Let me show you one thing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/

This thing. Take a look at this. At any time of the day, at any day of the week. Compare it to https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin, or https://www.reddit.com/r/btc, or any other subreddit in the world. Tell me any other subreddit that looks like that. While other subreddits spend most of their time and resources on random political discussions, Ethereum keeps silently building the new world economy, and you can watch that, live, on that subreddit. 

Have you seen DAI? The fact a fully decentralised stable coin and margin market survived the most extreme crypto winter in history is almost a miracle. You may not remember but that was one of Crypto's biggest flaws and now we have the solution for it. On Ethereum. And it just works. 

Have you seen StarkWare? It is easily the most advanced real cryptography company in the world, they're building snarks/starks which are essentially the philosopher's stone of crypto, they subsume and generalize almost every other cryptographic primitive as a single fundamental primitive, and guess where it is being built? Ethereum. 

Have you stopped to think how much of the top 100 currencies are [Ethereum tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/)?

I could go on and on, but the point I'm trying to make is something everyone silently knows. Bitcoiners know it, Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts know it, alternative coin enthusiasts know it. The entire field feels like a shill playground right now, all the loud kids trying to pump their favorite coin, while the ""serious adults"" work. While progress on every other coin has pretty much stagnated, an entire decentralised economy is being built on Ethereum, right now. What has Bitcoin accomplished in the last 3 years? And what Ethereum has? The most exciting new tech they have is LN, but they forget that there is no point in having an ultra-fast decentralised currency if all services built around it are centralised. And that's exact how things work today: for every centralised Bitcoin service or app, there is a decentralised Ethereum smart contract. Now, take a breath and think honestly: if Satoshi was alive right now, what project would he be proud about?

The only thing that could put doubt on my mind that Ethereum will soon take the first place is if we had another smart-contract project capable of competing with it. And what we got? EOS, fully centralised. Cardano, a beautiful project, but still vaporwar'ish; even if it delivers innovation, it has 2-3 years of dapp-development / network effect to catch up, which will probably not happen, since Ethereum can easily adopt any of its innovations anyway. Rootstock failed to deliver. What else? Nothing. Despite many attempts, it is clear nobody managed to put a competition to Ethereum.

As soon as Ethereum starts showing clear signs of strength, it isn't stopping. It almost passed Bitcoin once, and it is clearly a matter of time until it does. I have no doubt of that. That's why I didn't touch a single coin I hold: as long as Ethereum is still behind BTC, I know there is room to growth. Surely, if it passes Bitcoin tomorrow, it'll still be far from its ATH. But that's my personal benchmark. As soon as news start noticing about ""what is this Ethereum thing that everyone is talking about"", then I know it is time to sell some of my stake. Some, of course, because, after that, the fight will then be Ethereum vs USD / EUR. And I know who is winning that too..."

**tl;dr: Technical Analysis has some value, but don't base your trade on only TA. It tells you about how the markets collective psychology is, and that is the aspect you're looking for. It sets you up to see potential movements and understand why they might happen in a way that a fundamental analysis won't.**

---

We need to talk about technical analysis, and it's place in investment decisions. This is a sub about *trading*, and I don't want to sit idly by while this sub brainwashes itself into a HODL and forget-mentality, shutting its eyes to information that flies by.
 
On this sub, there's a widespread and accepted attitude that even looking at charts and attempting to derive any meaning from the price action, is utter hogwash and a fools errand. Since nobody knows where the price is going, looking at historical events to determine the future must be a waste of time, surely? Drawing fancypants triangles and lines between point A and B, only to land at a place that confirms your bias seems like a counterproductive venture, so why bother?
 
Well, yes. You're not wrong. But that is not the purpose of technical analysis, at least that's not the way the tool should be used in my opinion. There is no doubt that fundamental analysis beats out technical analysis in order of importance before any investment decision. But where technical analysis beats out fundamental analysis, is explaining the collective psychology of the investors in the market you're analysing. How they behave isn't necessarily related to the intrinsic value of the currency itself, but more connected to human psychology (*which is the sole reason bubbles exist - if psychology wasn't an issue, everything would be correctly priced way more often*). And the price action of the currency thus doesn't always operate rationally. 

**Let's dive right into it.**

---

> [This](http://imgur.com/y0LU16y) is the basic shape of a generic Harmonic Pattern - *or a triangle, if you will*. 
> 
> Looking at it out of context like that, it looks like something you'd see in any tarot-foreseers arsenal. How can these mean anything at all? Well, we're in luck because Ether today is a *perfect* example of the driving psychology that shapes these patterns!
> 
> [This](http://imgur.com/xlEApJy) is an image of the movements of Ether since the start of may, 1.5 month ago. It's a pretty bullish run up, before we took a tumble down today.

* ""[X](http://imgur.com/wY3zw29)"" - This is the start of the bullrun, people invest here because they see the currency being worth more than it's current market price.
* ""A"" - This is the current ATH. People sell now for various reasons, but among them are uncertainty, profit taking, fear etc. For whatever reason, the bullrun loses momentum and reverses.

> Now this is where it gets interesting.

* ""[B](http://imgur.com/wx0Vhto)"" - a point that the market again decides the currency is worth more than it's market price. So it attempts another run up. But this doesn't happen at random times - retracements often (*but not always!*) follow the [fibonacci ratios](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/04/033104.asp) (38%, 50%, 61% and 78% most notably), and pivot around these. You might've seen me or other people talk about the ""61% level of support"" etc - and that refers to these levels. And these levels go from top to down because we're measuring the *retracement* of a prior movement. The prior movement is from point X to A, and how far down it goes before it reverses is what we're looking for.

> In these patterns, there are certain rules and ratios to differentiate between them. Generally you can sort them by bearish or bullish, but the aforementioned fibonacci levels also differentiate between the different ones. Ones of these rules, is that point ""C"" will retrace between 61% to 100% of the AB leg. So I've drawn up that [here](http://imgur.com/CNM9YeY).
> 
> Now you might ask, where does psychology tie in with this? We're getting there. If you look at the last picture once more, you'll notice that C either is a double top (*if it retraces 100%*), or a lower high (*as in the image*). These are bearish signals. Now remember that people thought the currency was undervalued at ""B"", so generally there's bullish sentiment in this pattern. But for now, people are seeing signals indicating a selloff, and that's what they're reacting to.

* ""C"" - from this point the market sells off, and goes down below point ""B"". As the market was before willing to buy at this level, if we get a higher low than we had at X, it's generally respected as a reversal indicator. And people who sold at [C might see this](http://imgur.com/w8EXGFP) and buy in again at D.

* ""D"" - this point depends upon how the other points played out, and how you approach it will vary from ~~situation to situation~~ pattern to pattern. The rule of thumb is to be *prepared* for a *possible* reversal, and then decde for yourself if you have enough information to take a position based on that information. And yes, basing this decision solely on technical analysis is the controversial part. *It hasn't been proven to work better than the flip of a coin*. So why do people trade with this sketchy concept?

> *Because we're not trying to predict the future*! We're trying to find reasoning behind historic events (*past market movements*), and common events that can happen because of them. We're mapping a potential upcoming event, and preparing ourselves for that event - to not be taken by surprise, and left behind by the market. And when was *more information* ever a bad thing when it comes to making informed decisions? I'm not saying that there's informative predictions about where the price will be, but there's definitively information about how the market reacts to be read.

> So, why am I saying that Ether is a perfect example of the validity of triangles and socalled ""technical analysis""? Well, concider what we've seen in the daily chat today. People saying it's a bargain to buy now, people screaming to get out because it's gonna drop - wildly different thougths about what is going on, but definitely proof of the following:

* A will to buy the currency now.
* An idea that the currency is overvalued, and needs to drop further.

> 
> Doesn't these two reflect pretty well in [this shape's A and B points](http://imgur.com/H5c580W) as well? And with that said, is it really so unthinkable to *just keep your eyes open* for potential reversals in zones that are based on this pattern? After all, no investment decision has been made yet. You're just one step ahead because you can now understand and rationalize what you're seeing. It's not just blood everywhere, it's the psychology of the group pushing the price.
> 

---

Now taking this line of thought into Ether - we've seen a will to push up to A, and an event that drove the price down. There's people still thinking Ether is way underpriced, so a will to push up is still present. Therefore it's natural to expect a reversal at some point (*I'm treading the line now, I know - in the ""real world"", what moves the price is the fundamentals. But this is so early all we have now is adoption/speculative value*). Based on this, I'm just [drawing these lines](http://imgur.com/Bxh0oap) to see where the different patterns would have a reversal happen. I'm not saying it's going to happen, but these patterns are backtested and they occur often enough to be as valid as any other pennant, head / shoulder, flag etc. For that reason, I draw them up such that in the event they follow through from X to A to B to C (*without invalidating / breaking any ratios*), I will not be taken by surprise if the market soars after a reversal I missed (*the reason the market soars in that case is not because of a pattern, but the pattern does a good job of laying out for you what happened that you missed out on (in terms of psychology))*. Because I gathered information leading up to that event, I could hopefully have been prepared.
 
We're still far away from making the decision to take a position - but there's definitely a language here, and understanding it takes away a lot of the irrational fear of feeling your net worth plummet for no reason, and an urge to pull out your money.

---

I'm gonna stop right there, because I'm quite sure I've already bored you to death, even though there's so much to say about TA. And no, you're not getting a juicy prediction from me. I'll be happy if just a single one of you have given at least a passing thought to the concept of technical analysis by the end of this.

edit: and seeing as I write slow af, [this is the potential reversal zone](http://imgur.com/c9B6NWm) for C in the event that this were to proceed to validate as a harmonic pattern. If we were to drop down below B again, that just means the first B wasn't the actual reversal, and as long as it is within the 38-78%, it's still a valid B.

edit 2: And if we aren't going to bea the previous ATH, [this is the reversal zone](http://imgur.com/VWWhfDj) for C.

After reading some of the responses, I should say that I managed to get him to consider diversifying his money with the top 3 coins. Although he has asked me about Ripple many times. Doesn't know anything about crypto but knows about banking."

This morning: When Its longer than you expect,1614593148.0,
This room feels like Q4 2016 all over again,1520941235.0,"This isn't  a pump piece but more of an observations piece.

Does anyone feel like this is Q4 2016 all over again?  I'm talking about price and sentiment here in this sub specifically when we had less than 5000 members.  I'm probably not going to get a lot of old timers to chime in here but our numbers have gone 10x+ in terms of members and everything is magnified.

The main difference this time pricewise is we're fighting for $1000 instead of $10.  Just reading everything on Reddit yesterday with /u/laughncow [crash graph comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/83xplk/here_is_a_history_of_crypto_corrections/?st=jepjvgad&sh=6178e015) reminds me of the troll winter here in EthTrader back in Q4 2016....lots of long timers were starting bailing out because they'd never seen a crash before that big. MANY MANY people bought at the high range $18-$22 (yes including me) and were capitulating under $12 hoping to get back in around $3 ""because they'd seen it in Bitcoin before"".  And then the reversal took place at $5.85....so my mind thinks the market wants to see yet a 3rd dip to $585 to complete the painting of the tape.  I will not dare sell here.  So be it if it does. 



*""um..guys are we gonna be like 2014 400 day long bear again?""...""guys are we?""*

When I here this fear I get the feeling that someone over invested.  Don't over-invest. I made that mistake in that  particular year.  You can use risky money if you are younger but PLEASE don't use emergency money.  One unforeseen medical bill forced my hand to sell at a loss that year. PLEASE don't use emergency money like I did.

Now fundamentals have improved dramatically in terms of conference attendance, community participation, EEA, truffle use, DAPPS going through final audits/testing, OMG plasma in May along with  a whole new wave media/gov/companies everywhere piling in the space and concern trolls are really truly worried we may revisit $100 again.  REALLY?  

  *""I'll be back in when we complete the retrace to $100-$200. I hate to see $300 break but it may""* blah blah blah. 

I know I'm a man of many rose colored glasses. There are ALWAYS going to politics and regulation fears in crypto.  Just get it in your head that crypto is here to stay. The US at least is wanting your tax dollars any way they can and crypto is no longer something that has a fear of being wiped (which it can't anyway but that's a different philosophy thread) but rather being considering a BOOMING new asset class.  An asset class that has proven to be a very low barrier to entry asset class with much to prove in terms of utility and trustless settlements.  

You can buy now, buy later, sell now, sell later.  4 choices.  I personally think the band-aid is off and the next move up may leave you the way the reversal left so many traders at the station Q1 2017 particularly in April 2017.  Traders back then who had sold at $10 never reentered because the price hit $50 and was still ""overvalued"". Now here we are just just under the new $7 in my book.  

I'm beginning to think market makers are holding a lower ceiling here and the higher lows are coming.  I can feel it.   Bitcoin needs to shit the bed one more time and let the strong hands go deep in around $7500,  ETH ratio holds/goes higher here,  we touch $550-$625 or so and then the train leaves the good gosh golly darn station again.   No problem doing some DCA here.  Just some thoughts.  

Project to January 2020 for a bit. What do you see?

Who wants to see Vitalik go on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast (JRE)?,1536596934.0,Joe does a great podcast and could provide a unique conversation format that could expose ethereum to a large democratic.

Eth will outrun Bitcoin in long run,1619865736.0,
"It's time to take back the narrative around Ether and Ethereum. Ethereum is the future of digital, decentralized finance.",1536604766.0,"Has anyone noticed that pretty much *every single important financial dapp* gets built upon Ethereum, including two stable coin announcements just today ([[1]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/astanley/2018/09/10/new-york-dfs-greenlights-paxos-ethereum-based-stablecoin/#5bee2f21520c), [[2]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/07/winklevoss-brothers-launch-ethereum-token-backed-by-us-dollars/#34ef0247e1f6))?  Name another network that comes even close.  The ""competition"" can't touch this kind of network effect, and the value of that effect is only going to compound over time (especially as dapps become interoperable with one another), even through this bear market.  While some investors are panicking, the developers keep building.  Ethereum will decentralize many existing forms of economic activity, and more importantly, create entirely new forms of economic activity that were never before possible.

That activity is hardly limited to stable coins- although Ethereum boasts the first truly decentralized stable coin (Maker Dai).  It also now hosts tokenized gold (Digix), decentralized exchanges (0x-powered, etc.), fungible asset tokens (almost all ERC-20 / ICO tokens), all sorts of non-fungible property tokens (CryptoKitties, Major League Baseball collectibles, Gods Unchained and Zombie Battleground collectible gaming cards), etc.  The list goes on, and on.  And it's literally just getting started.

*We're at a (temporary) point where a lot of people don't really understand Ethereum, ETH, or its true value proposition.*  Some of those people have bought and since sold their ETH. Probably because it's a lot more complicated (and useful) than most projects in this space, with a narrative that may not be easy to understand.  ""Digital gold"" is easy to understand, so is ""privacy coin,"" heck, even ""bank settlement coin"" (even though XRP has no shot at delivering this, in my opinion).

But the ""world's shared computer"" is hard to understand.  And what are ""trust machines"" and ""asset ledgers""?   What the hell is a ""smart contract""?  And isn't ""digital oil"" you convert into ""gas"" something you consume and burn that is bad for the environment- why hold it?

*We haven't done a great job with the branding of this thing,* probably because this idea is so revolutionary, it's hard to grasp and explain.  And perhaps because so many good people in this community are focused on actually building stuff, rather than trying to hype it.  Meanwhile in other crypto communities, *all you have* are people working to create hype, because the assets they're promoting serve no purpose.

And that's fine, but after these fires have burned out, some of us will work to retake the narrative around ETH from *Other Coin Maximalists* who have attempted to falsely reduce ETH's value proposition to being a ""simple utility shitcoin"" and continue to wage what I can only call a coordinated FUD campaign.  *And they only feel emboldened to do so because they see Ethereum as a legitimate threat, and are frightened by what this increased economic activity on Ethereum will mean for their own coins.*

For those that don't get it, [ETH could be very valuable in the future and the keystone to an entire decentralized economy,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7mwbbc/will_proof_of_stake_turn_eth_into_the_best_store/) especially as the network transitions to Proof of Stake, where the price of Ether will be directly correlated with Ethereum network security.  And with supply inflation that is close to zero or possibly even negative, it *could possibly become the world's best decentralized store of value*.  Seeing these financial dapps continue to build upon Ethereum, even in the depths of this bear market only reinforces one important point to me:

***Ether (ETH) will become the native currency of the internet- it's going to power Web 3.0, and it will be the central pillar of an entirely new, decentralized economy that has never been possible before- all built on top of the Ethereum network.***

The next cycle in crypto will show us just how important this innovation will be, even beyond ICO-fundraising, which in of itself was an important use case that was never before possible at scale.  Of course there are risks that this may not happen, but name one project that has a better shot at it than Ethereum?  I think the world ~~wants~~ needs this type of decentralized finance, and in the coming years, you will watch Ethereum deliver it.

Call this ""hopium"" if you want, but I'll call it *focusing on fundamentals* in a crypto-sphere that seems almost entirely devoid of all fundamentals, save for a couple of projects.  Run for the exits if you need to, selling off your long term holdings and opening your shorts, but in your panic / greed, I'll be buying your cheap ETH once the dust starts to settle.  For those of you who chose to hold through this, remember to keep the long term picture in mind- you will likely be rewarded as a new day of decentralized finance dawns."

Also /u/savage_x as well had [valid criticisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/9odwn3/your_thoughts_on_tether_poll/e7tgt7h). I think both these guys need to do a poll with a better question/answers than this one.  Anyone can make polls.  Try it out.

The word ""Important"" is not a great word choice. It implies there is a problem with Tether and the word ""Disappear"" can mean different things.  It may be a good thing that it disappears LOL.  It may not be a good thing depending on the circumstances.

Hi /r/ethtrader! I quit my job to start Cointaxes to answer questions about taxes and digital currencies so you can have confidence even if you're not a HODLer! Sharing our first comprehensive article on the Coinbase & Gemini 1099-K. Would love your input on ANY other topics or questions! :),1518100314.0,"Hi /r/ethtrader! Thank you for reading this. 

I felt the world of digital currencies is a bit too uncertain, so I want to do what I can to create more confidence and certainty! Please let me know if you have any questions or comments (I'll probably respond to every comment here!)

> [**Check out our first comprehensive article on the Coinbase / Gemini 1099-K**](https://www.cointaxes.com/1099)

* **Non-deductible personal loss:** You should never exchange your digital currency directly for ANY goods or services. If you happen to have a loss on that trade, it will be non-deductable as capital gains losses ONLY apply to ""investment"" not ""personal use"" activity.

* **FBAR requirements:** This isn't explicitly tax related, actually, but a LOT of my US friends do not know about this important filing. If you *ever* on a single day, even, held $10,000 USD worth of value overseas (Binance, for example), you must meet your FBAR online filing requirements. The penalties can be severe for failure to disclose. The deadline is April 15, but it will be extended to October 15 if you fail to file on time.

Cointaxes was formed and funded with the mission to establish confidence and certainty around cryptocurrency.

We see global adoption of digital currencies as an inevitability. The uncertainty lies in how effectively and smoothly this once-in-a-lifetime shift occurs.

The Bull: a Three-Term Take on ETH,1522962987.0,"Welp, looks like it's time to try and counter some of the negativity, fud, and trolling infecting the board lately.  The sentiment reminds me a lot of Q4 2016 (after the DAObacle and the subsequent bleed out of ETH from $20.00+ down to $6.00 and the accompanying existential dread). 

Here's a brief look at why I'm short-, medium-, and long-term bullish on the Ethereum project (and by extension ETH). 

***Short-Term***

* **1: dApps**: The first (and some of the greatest) dApps on Ethereum have launched or will be launching soon.  

* * **a: Maker** is already an unmitigated success and could very well become the go-to stablecoin by the end of this year.  (I can‚Äôt overstate how impressed I am with Maker; it‚Äôs truly a revolutionary project in and of itself, and operating within the Ethereum ecosystem is a beautiful synergism that will only help both endeavors in the long run). 

* * **b: Golem** looks to be launching Brass on the main net soon.  This is still one of the sexiest projects out there, both in the mainstream and crypto communities.  Granted, some of the lustre has worn off given the team‚Äôs tendency to overpromise and under deliver (and their terrible PR), but if they can deliver even a fraction of what they‚Äôre looking to accomplish, GNT (and again by extension ETH) could be prime for an explosion and could bring more mainstream eyeballs and adopters to the space. 

* * **c: Digix** Gold-backed tokens.  Another stable-currency of sorts, but more importantly, the first serious tokenization of real-world assets.  Launching on main net soon. 

* * **d: Augur** will launch on the main net in a matter of weeks (not months?).  Prediction markets are a perfect fit for blockchain.  And, yes, there is more use for Augur than simply gambling on sports.  Individuals and corporations alike could self-insure / hedge on a micro- or macro-basis.                                                                                                                                                      

* * * *Example*: Farmer Frida worries about her crops in the irregular dry seasons that afflict her region.  She decides to insure herself by establishing a prediction market wherein she bets that there will be at least one dry season in the next four.  If she loses the bet, *great*, because that means she has had four wet seasons and the good crops that come with them.  If she wins, she‚Äôll collect on the bet and be able to better weather a dry season (and the diminished crop that resulted).  This  kind of insurance / hedging has only ever been possible at an institutional level and at amounts that are either prohibitively expensive or just don‚Äôt make sense for the average individual.  Augur makes it all possible at a fully decentralized, micro level.

* **2: Consensus**: maybe the largest blockchain conference in the West, last year‚Äôs conference came when ETH hit $100 (it seems almost quaint to look back and watch some of the conference participants gush about hitting that milestone).  May 14-16 should be a nice shot in the arm for blockchain generally and Ethereum specifically. 

* **3: Price Action**: Both BTC and ETH seem to be consolidating (finally) around $6,500-7,500 and $370-410, respectively.  Bulls and Bears seem to be content to graze quietly in their fields and woods. (If you had told me this time last year that the board would be licking its wounds at this price level, I‚Äôd have told you you were insane; if you had told me that we‚Äôd hit a high at $1,400 I‚Äôd have slapped you and called the state mental health institute).  

***Medium-Term***        

* **1: Scaling**: The Ethereum Foundation is working furiously toward scaling solutions (as well as the migration away from PoW). Plasma, Sharding, Casper, are all priorities for the Foundation and its other allies in building out a scaled, decentralized blockchain.  If *anyone* can do it, they can.  (Note, scaling has plagued blockchain for almost 10 years, but it plagues every network and organization.  IMO, this is still the biggest question mark in whether Ethereum can become the Web 3.0 it wants to be or merely a blockchain solution; if the former, watch out, because we‚Äôll all be the oil barons of the 21st century; if the latter, we‚Äôll still be well off from here). 

* **2: EEA**:  The EEA continues to add interesting allies, but maybe more importantly for the medium-term, plans to make a marketing push.  A polished, Ethereum-focused marketing campaign could be just what Ethereum needs to gain the kind of mainstream traction that will push it to the top of the heap in terms of price and adoption.    

* **3: Institutional Investment**: Physically settled futures is the first step toward ETFs, which would allow more and more institutions to get on board with the latest commodity asset.  And when I say institutional, it‚Äôs not just corporations and banks; think sovereign funds and fixed-income providers with trillions at their collective disposal.  Even without ETFs or other more traditional investment vehicles, you could more and more hedge funds, family funds, and corporations getting on board and buying crypto currencies as part of their portfolio. 

* **4: Proof of Stake**:  PoW is getting a bad wrap in mainstream media‚Äîexpensive, environmentally unfriendly (we can all disagree about the degree to which PoW contributes to pollution, but no one would argue that it doesn‚Äôt contribute much more than PoS would), and already being pushed out of communities and jurisdictions that don‚Äôt want to sell all their power to a handful of crypto mines.  PoW also inevitably leads to some degree of centralization based on economics alone.  Staking brings with it the promise of a cleaner, just as secure blockchain, as well as dividend-like rewards for stakers.  If implemented successfully, PoS could make ETH the most attractive cryptocurrency by itself (let alone the network and platform that it enables). 

***Long-Term***

* **1: Web 3.0**:  This goes without saying, but if ETH can scale to the level it aims to and can create a robust, dApp-driven platform, it would be world-changing (and the price would more than likely reflect that).  Even if ETH only manages to provide a decentralized backbone to just a handful of successful and widely adopted blockchain projects, the price could still soar.

* **2: dApp Store**:  The analogy isn‚Äôt perfect, but if Ethereum becomes a dApp store and ETH is the fuel/toll for operating on the Ethereum blockchain, you could be looking at the next edition of the Apple / Android App Stores.  ETH holders and stakers will have effective shares of that dApp store on their hands‚Äîbenefiting from both platform usage (scarcity / security, etc.) and the resulting price action and from staking, whether individually or in a pool.  This alone could drive a market cap into close-to a trillion dollars.

* **3: Widespread Adoption**: If (when?) Ethereum becomes the go-to blockchain for individual and enterprise solutions (and it is easily the best situated to do that from today‚Äôs perspective), the demand (and value) of ETH will track accordingly.  And, as we know from the last 10 years of the evolution of the internet (see: social media), networks have a geometric effect on value as they spread. 

* * Get thousands of people using applications on the Ethereum blockchain routinely‚Äîprice is great. 
* * Get a million people using applications on the Ethereum blockchain routinely‚Äîprice is huge.   
* * Get a billion+ people using application son the Ethereum blockchain routinely‚Äîprice is unimaginable. 

* **4: Unforeseeable Usage**: When the internet was first coming to mainstream adoption, no one quite knew what to make of it.  The idea of an internet-based marketplace was almost farcical‚Äîwho would want to buy something without seeing / smelling / touching / trying it first? The same went with banking, purchasing, storing knowledge bases, etc.  We know how that went.  What other use cases will blockchain enable? Can we even fathom them right now?  Could you have envisioned a fleet of driverless vehicles summoned on your smart phone just a decade ago?  How about five years ago?                                                 
* * Technology is wild.  Ethereum and blockchain are on the bleeding edge and are just building up momentum. 

**TL; DR**: The future is extremely bright.  Strap in. Enjoy the ride. And don't get bucked off on anyone's terms but yours.  "

$1000 Ether prediction give away,1502794423.0,"Hello friends!

In these dark times, it is important to keep our chins and our spirits high, and so I have decided to start a little game! It's very simple, really. All you have to do is PREDICT the date and time when Ether's price will hit $1000 on Bitfinex in this thread (sorry, but only accounts with at least some posts / karma will be considered just in case someone is lame enough to try and spam this with multiple ones!). When (note how I say when and not if because let's face it, we all know it's coming) Ether's price does in fact reach $1000, I will present the person whose guess was closest with **an all-inclusive 7-10 day holiday for two in either Bali, Indonesia, or the Dominican Republic.** (your pick of destination and dates). 

Feel free to refer your friends from other subs here, but do remember, only real accounts. **The submission deadline is 1st of September.**

Let the games begin!

edit: **Guys, given the amount of entries coming in, you should definitely specify a TIME along with your date. There are quite a few duplicate dates already, if there is more than one person calling the 'winning' date then the closest TIME guessed will be the winner, otherwise I'll have to like, pull a random number or come up with some other, more devious way to pick the winner.**

edit2: **The submission deadline closed more than 2 months ago, folks. It's cool to see people coming back to this now, though, loving the renewed hope =)**"

There's no official announcement from the SEC that they will be announcing any decision today about Ethereum.  The US Gov't can't even decide what Cryptos are.  The CFTC wants them as commodities and the SEC is incentivized to claim them as securities but they are neither.  Crypto Currencies like ETH are currencies that live and bread on the Internet outside of all Government jurisdictions.  Japan made the right move last Spring in 2017 by labeling and regulating Cryptos for what they really are - CURRENCIES with no tax when exchanged just like any other foreign currency.  The US Government is CORRUPT as SHIT.

For a few reasons my wife and I are not able to have a baby the old fashioned way and it seemed that adoption was the only way we would be able to start a family. We saved for a few years and tried IVF 3 times. Needless to say it did not work. Anyone who is familiar with the process knows that it is extremely painful, physically and mentally. Lots of money down the drain, no baby, super sad wife and upset me.

We are a middle class family and some of you may or may not know that adoption can be extremely expensive. On top of being expensive it is often a very long process as many families are put on a long waiting list. We got lucky and got a referral from a family friend and an adoption attorney took us on as clients and paired us with a birthmom. We were ecstatic to say the least but we had no idea how we were going to fund the process. 

No, not crypto, not yet. 

We worked our asses off, lived on my paycheck and saved hers. I sold my car and we borrowed money from family. We ended up selling our house, paying family off and having a small amount of money and good enough credit to get into another house. Baby came, healthy girl, happy days! She is the light of our life and I can even begin to explain how surreal the last 3 years have been.  

Enough back story.

13 months after baby girl is born we get phone call (March 2017), birth mother is pregnant again. Lawyer says he feels obligated to keep siblings together if possible but if we couldn't do it he totally understands and that there is a long list of willing families to take this baby . Wife says of course we will take the baby and then realizes she has to talk to me. I say how can we afford it? We barely made our bills during the last process, we have little to no savings (kids are expensive)! Oh wait! I've been buying little bits of something called bitcoin for some years now and earlier this year I sold it all for something called Ethereum! I have money?!?! Holy shit we can adopt her brother! FUCK YEAH. 

So yeah, I didn't get a lambo, pay off my house or my student loan. I grew my family, something I would not have been able to do otherwise. I bought in at around $11, shortly after it was put on coinbase and you guys know the rest. I don't have a ton by any means and this will more than likely eat 75%-80% of my stack but it's worth it and the peace of mind to not have to stress about it is amazing. I have also diversified in some other coins I believe in, so who knows what will happen. I wanted to share because I thought it was a unique story, maybe the only crypto based adoption story out there. And dont worry, with what I have left I am HODLing.....until I can pay off my student loan, house or lambo ;)

Now i have been waiting 4 weeks for replies.

It is the same for everyone who is trying to register an account, a ton of people have a hard time getting money onto the exchanges.

Something needs to be done about this, not because i care about quick adoption or a big bull run, but simply that a free market would not allow this to continue, which leads me to the conclussion that we arent in a free market, we are in the grips of a few companies that have a monopoly on the market.

Can someone come up with an idea to remedy this please?

Maybe one of you heroes out there has the skill to put up a company and make an ICO so that we can have a community owned/operated exchange.

My suggestion is to set it up in Malta, the government is very blockchain friendly here. I can help you with the contacts on the island.


Edit: Good job guys! looks like our little experiment paid off, coinbase is the first exchange to capitulate and offer up an appology and a road map to solve this problem, my thinking is that this will force the rest of the exchanges to follow suit.

How Eth Changed My Life (and it's not what you think),1515136936.0,"(Background- I have been a sous chef for years. Never had more than 5k in my bank account and work 12 hour days regularly. )

Last year I bought 144 Eth at the going price of around $10. My goal was to buy a van and travel the country with my girlfriend, so when Eth skyrocketed to $17 I sold and bought a 97 Dodge Van.

I spent all summer converting the van to a camper and saving my pennies. The van is now done and we are about to take off. Can you believe my surprise when out of curiosity I checked the price of Eth? My cheap old van now cost me somewhere around $100k!

For a while, I was bitter. I looked with disdain at my new house on wheels, thinking about the life-changing amount of money it cost me.

Then, I remembered it was Eth that quickly got me the savings I needed. It was Eth that bought me a van I my partner and I will make memories in forever.

So if you sold early, or missed a dip or bought high, remember that there will always be opportunities you will miss and money you could have made, but be grateful for the things in your life that aren't about money. Think about the ways you can change and change others lives around you if you held. Take a breather from the screen."
